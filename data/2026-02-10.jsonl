With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky."}

Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively)."}

They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly."}

Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K.

This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively.

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows."}

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses.

Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses.

In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg.\n  We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion.

The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning.

All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets.

Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained.

For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$Δβ$ plane, where $Δβ$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions.

In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere.

A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows."}

While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause)."}

This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000\\,K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000\\,K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates. We proved this on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares."}

Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($α_A $ and $α_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $α$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \\pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \\pm 0.0015$.

Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga.

In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system."}

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$).

Comments welcome", "summary": "PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula."}

While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $ν_\\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $ν_\\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs. Finally, we contribute a dataset linking granulation, oscillations, and stellar parameters, providing a foundation for future investigations into their interdependence across the HR diagram."}

The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $Σ$-effect model of \\cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $Σ$-effect in reality."}

The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\\approx 0.9 R_{\\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed.

Examination of the HI morphology in this area of sky shows that the star and HI features exists in a large cavity in interstellar HI surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association. The cavity may have been created by an ancient supernova. It is hypothesized that the pair of HI features and filamentary HI structure found in its immediate vicinity may be the remnants of a planetary nebula some 3 x 10^5 years old that have cooled to the point that the gas is neutral and emitting the 21-cm spectral line. This remnant has maintained the morphological characteristics of the original planetary nebula because it expanded into a volume of space relatively devoid of interstellar gas that would otherwise have absorbed any traces of the original nebula."}

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium."}

With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky."}

Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows."}

Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($α_A $ and $α_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $α$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \\pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \\pm 0.0015$.

Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies."}

In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula."}
