*Viraj Karambelkar,Kishalay De,Lynne A. Hillenbrand,J. L. Sokoloski,Danielle Frostig,Julianne Dalcanton*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: SPHEREx mission enables systematic study of IR transients by providing low-resolution spectra for NEOWISE-discovered outbursts, identifying new FUOrs and novae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a new strategy for studying infrared transients by leveraging the synergy between SPHEREx's spectro-photometric capabilities and NEOWISE's long-term mid-IR monitoring, enabling systematic exploration of the dynamic infrared sky.

Method: Utilize NEOWISE's 15-year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage to discover slowly evolving IR outbursts, then use SPHEREx's matching mid-IR sensitivity and all-sky spectro-photometric coverage to obtain low-resolution IR spectra for classification and analysis.

Result: SPHEREx spectra obtained for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE, including two known FUOrs showing cool molecular absorption, three known classical novae with strong emission lines, plus identification of two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova.

Conclusion: The SPHEREx mission demonstrates significant potential for systematic exploration of the dynamic infrared sky, particularly for obscured transients inaccessible to ground-based spectroscopy, through its synergy with NEOWISE data.

Abstract: We demonstrate proof-of-concept of a new strategy for studying infrared (IR) transients enabled by the newly launched SPHEREx space mission, by leveraging its synergy with the NEOWISE space mission. With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky.

### [2] [Assessment of DKIST/VTF Capabilities for the Detection of Local Acoustic Source Wavefronts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07137)
*Corinne Morrell,Mark P. Rast,Shah Mohammad Bahauddin,Ivan Milić*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Observational strategy for detecting local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using DKIST/VTF, focusing on optimal wavelength combinations to maximize wave signal sensitivity while minimizing atmospheric contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend temporal filtering capabilities from simulations to observations for studying solar p-mode excitation, source depth distribution, and enabling ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics.

Method: Assessment of observational strategy using DKIST/VTF, identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize sensitivity to wave signals at optimal atmospheric heights under cadence and spectral resolution constraints.

Result: Two possible strategies identified: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 Å, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either Fe I 6302.5 Å (6302.419-6302.465 Å) or Fe I 5250.6 Å (5250.579-5250.607 Å) lines.

Conclusion: The study provides concrete observational strategies for detecting acoustic wavefronts in solar observations using DKIST/VTF, enabling future investigations into solar acoustic wave excitation and ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).

### [3] [Variation of the sunspot area during the rising and declining phases of the solar cycle supports the toroidal flux loss due to flux emergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07194)
*Bidya Binay Karak,Soumya Mishra,Anu Sreedevi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Sunspot group areas and BMR fluxes are larger during solar cycle rising phases than declining phases, making rising phases more prone to intense space weather. Distribution statistics show cycle-strength dependence during rising phases but independence during decline phases, supporting nonlinear flux loss theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical properties of sunspot group areas and BMR fluxes across solar cycles, and connect these observations with dynamo theory to explain why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.

Method: Analysis of sunspot group area data from past 13 solar cycles and Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux data for Cycles 23 and 24. Statistical examination of area and flux distributions, comparison between rising and declining phases, and investigation of cycle-strength dependence.

Result: 1) Sunspot group areas and BMR fluxes are statistically larger during rising phases than declining phases. 2) Rising phases are more prone to intense space weather. 3) Mean and median of area distribution during rising phase depend on cycle strength. 4) Distribution statistics during decline phases are cycle-strength independent or weakly dependent, especially in last three years when latitudinal bands migrate toward equator along same trajectory.

Conclusion: The results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly. The findings provide observational evidence connecting sunspot properties with dynamo theory and have implications for space weather forecasting.

Abstract: Sunspots are obvious observable manifestations of the toroidal magnetic field generated through the dynamo in the convection zone. They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.

### [4] [A Detailed Model Atmosphere Analysis of Hot White Dwarfs in DESI DR1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07246)
*Mukremin Kilic,Pierre Bergeron,Adam Moss,Simon Blouin,Matthew J. Green,Gracyn Jewett,Manuel Barrientos,Alexander L. Albright,Warren R. Brown*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of 19,321 hot white dwarfs from DESI DR1 reveals systematic mass discrepancies between photometric and spectroscopic methods for DA white dwarfs, identifies magnetic white dwarfs among ultramassive DAs and warm DQs in non-DAs, and provides insights into spectral evolution across 10⁵-10⁴ K temperature range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the first large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates observed with DESI spectroscopy, addressing systematic issues in white dwarf mass determinations and understanding spectral evolution across temperature ranges.

Method: Combined DESI spectroscopy with Gaia parallaxes and multi-band photometry (SDSS, Pan-STARRS, SkyMapper) to perform both spectroscopic and photometric fits on 19,321 hot white dwarfs with G_BP-G_RP ≤ 0.

Result: Found systematic 0.05-0.06 M⊙ offset between photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs, indicating issues with hydrogen line profiles in DESI data. Photometric fits show canonical 0.6 M⊙ peak. Identified magnetic white dwarfs among ultramassive DAs and warm DQs in non-DA distribution, including 70 DQs (9 DAQs). Constrained non-DA to DA ratio evolution with temperature.

Conclusion: This analysis reveals systematic problems in DESI spectroscopy for white dwarf mass determinations, provides insights into white dwarf spectral evolution, and serves as a foundation for future multiplexed spectroscopic surveys (SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE) that will observe similar Gaia-selected samples.

Abstract: We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.

### [5] [Emergence of a lithium dip in ~35 Myr "Snake" Open Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07367)
*Yun-Yi Zhang,Hai-Jun Tian,Jian-Rong Shi,Cheng-Cheng Xie,Xiang-Ming Yang*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Discovery of a lithium dip in the young (35 Myr) "Snake" cluster challenges the classical view that Li-dips only emerge at ages ≥150 Myr, revealing an earlier onset and correlation with rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the classical understanding that lithium dips in stars only appear at ages greater than 150 Myr by investigating a much younger open cluster, and to explore the relationship between rotation and lithium depletion.

Method: Used high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 (R ∼ 28,000) for 211 member stars of the "Snake" cluster (age = 35 ± 5 Myr) to measure lithium abundances and rotational velocities, analyzing correlations between effective temperature, lithium depletion, and rotation.

Result: Identified a clear lithium dip in the temperature range 6200-6800 K with depletion depth ΔA(Li) ≈ 0.40 dex, appearing ≥100 Myr earlier than previous observations. Found significant correlation between rotational velocity and lithium depletion: fast rotators (v sin i > 25 km s⁻¹) show stronger depletion than slow rotators (v sin i < 25 km s⁻¹). Also discovered the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for young open clusters.

Conclusion: The discovery challenges the classical timeline for lithium dip formation, suggesting faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, enhancing turbulent mixing and accelerating lithium destruction. This provides new insights into stellar evolution mechanisms and the timescales of lithium depletion processes.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a lithium dip (Li-dip) in the stellar "Snake" (age = $35 \pm 5$ Myr), challenging the classical view that Li-dips emerge only at ages $\gtrsim 150$ Myr. Using high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 ($R \sim 28,000$) for 211 member stars, we identify a clear depletion feature in a $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ range of 6200--6800 K with a depth of $ΔA(\mathrm{Li}) \approx 0.40$ dex. Our analysis reveals two key advances: the Li-dip appears $\gtrsim 100$ Myr earlier than the previous observations, and within the dip temperature range, a significant correlation is found between rotational velocity and lithium depletion. Specifically, fast rotators ($v \sin i > 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \sin i < 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction. It is also found that the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for the young open clusters.

### [6] [Twisted Pseudodisk and Asymmetric Mass Accretion on the Circumstellar Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07741)
*Masahiro N. Machida,Shingo Hirano,Shantanu Basu*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 3D resistive MHD simulations show that misaligned magnetic fields in prestellar cores lead to complex pseudodisk evolution, asymmetric accretion via narrow streams, and variable protostellar accretion, even without turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how misalignment between magnetic fields and rotation axes in prestellar cores affects gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks, pseudodisk evolution, and accretion variability, without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.

Method: Three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations starting from a prestellar core without turbulence, with misalignment between initial magnetic field and rotation axis, evolving for ~10^5 years after protostar formation.

Result: Magnetic fields become significantly distorted around the disk due to rotational motion, leading to complex pseudodisk morphology. Accretion onto the disk becomes asymmetric and anisotropic, occurring primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. Time evolution of the infalling envelope causes non-steady accretion onto the disk, resulting in variability in mass accretion onto the central protostar.

Conclusion: Complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto circumstellar disks naturally arise from misaligned magnetic fields in prestellar cores, even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows, explaining observed accretion variability.

Abstract: We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.

### [7] [Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA II. Impact of Physical and Numerical Assumptions on Elemental Abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08109)
*O. Ziółkowska,R. Smolec,A. Thoul,R. Singh Rathour,V. Hocdé*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes uncertainties in surface and central abundances of evolved stars (2-8 solar masses) due to variations in stellar evolution modeling parameters, finding small surface abundance uncertainties but significant variations in central C/O ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern stellar evolution tools like MESA introduce many unconstrained free parameters, particularly problematic for evolved stars like classical Cepheids where uncertainties increase with evolution time. Previous work studied microphysics variations; this work extends to surface abundances of key elements.

Method: Established reference model plus 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving from Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses: 2-8 solar masses; metallicities: Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014. Both canonical and overshooting models computed and compared.

Result: Surface abundance uncertainties are generally small, mainly from variations in convective envelope depth during first dredge-up. Convective envelope size sensitive to mass and metallicity. Central C/O ratio varies by ~0.15, driven by convective boundary treatments or 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate modifications during helium burning.

Conclusion: The study quantifies abundance uncertainties in stellar evolution modeling, providing benchmark surface and central abundance data online for classical Cepheid parameter space, highlighting sensitivity of key abundance ratios to specific modeling choices.

Abstract: Modern tools for modeling stellar evolution, such as MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), offer state-of-the-art implementations of stellar theories. However, this parametric approach introduces many free parameters that are often not constrained by observations. This is particularly important for evolved stars, like classical Cepheids, because uncertainties increase with evolution time. In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg.
  We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses between 2 to 8 solar mass and metallicities Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014 are explored, spanning the range of classical Cepheids. Both canonical and overshooting models are computed and compared.
  We find that uncertainties in surface abundances are generally small, arising mainly from variations in the depth of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning. Surface and central abundances for the considered models at several benchmark points during the evolution are provided online.

### [8] [Dynamics of Y Dwarf Atmospheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08434)
*C. Akın,E. K. H. Lee,L. Gkouvelis,K. Heng*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Y dwarf atmospheric circulation is dominated by interior thermal radiation with weak winds, minimal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets; clouds play secondary role in this parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs (Y dwarfs) remains largely unexplored, particularly the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback in their atmospheres.

Method: Used twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning effective temperatures 400-600 K and rotation periods 2.5-20 hours; developed additional physics modules for THOR GCM including interior thermal perturbations, mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers with thermal feedback and scattering; included KCl, Na₂S, and MnS clouds.

Result: All simulations show radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets; convection controls vertical mixing and sets extent of salt/sulfide cloud layers below photosphere; thermal structures equilibrate quickly with limited variability; clouds play secondary role; rotation sets modest variability.

Conclusion: Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation; the single-band approach likely provides conservative constraints on cloud radiative feedback; pathways toward more active regimes are outlined for future work.

Abstract: The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.

### [9] [A single frequency approach to nonequilibrium modeling of the chromosphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08763)
*W. Ruan,D. Przybylski,R. Cameron,S. K. Solanki*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Updated MURaM code incorporates Lyman line radiative transfer for more accurate chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution, using single-frequency approximation to reduce computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The solar chromosphere requires accurate non-LTE radiative transfer modeling due to significant departures from LTE caused by long ionization/relaxation timescales, particularly for strong spectral lines like Lyman lines that contribute substantially to radiative energy exchange.

Method: Extended MURaM code by incorporating radiative transfer for Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and associated radiative losses, using single-frequency approximation for each line to reduce computational cost while solving population and temperature evolution equations self-consistently.

Result: The extended model shows good agreement with Lightweaver framework reference solutions, accurately capturing Lyman line radiative processes. Hydrogen level populations in deep chromosphere approach detailed radiative balance while upper chromosphere remains significantly out of balance, consistent with real solar atmosphere conditions.

Conclusion: The MURaM code extension enables accurate capture of chromospheric dynamics by properly modeling Lyman line radiative transfer, bringing simulated hydrogen level populations closer to realistic conditions throughout the chromosphere.

Abstract: The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics.

### [10] [Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08806)
*Shishir Biswas,Masaru Nakanotani,Dinshaw S. Balsara,Vladimir Florinski,Merav Opher*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in collisionless plasmas using CGL equations shows reduced growth rates and magnetic effects compared to MHD, with energy diverted to pressure anisotropies rather than field line bending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While KH instability is well-studied in MHD, limited research exists in collisionless regimes where anisotropic pressures develop, particularly relevant for heliospheric and interstellar environments where collisionless conditions prevail.

Method: Comprehensive analysis using linearised techniques and numerical simulations comparing CGL (Chew-Goldberger-Low) equations with MHD framework, focusing on anisotropic pressure tensor effects in collisionless plasmas.

Result: Largest growth rates and strongest magnetic effects occur in MHD limit; CGL regime diverts energy to pressure anisotropies, reducing field line bending, current densities, and magnetic island formation compared to MHD.

Conclusion: CGL treatment of KH instability reveals fundamental differences from MHD, with implications for turbulence and reconnection in heliosheath and other collisionless astrophysical environments.

Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).

### [11] [New Approach to Superflare Energy Determination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08814)
*Petr Heinzel,Robert Falewicz,Kamil Bicz,Paweł Preś*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: New method for estimating stellar flare energies using time-dependent temperature evolution with constant emitting area, improving accuracy over fixed-temperature approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating flare energies typically assume a fixed temperature of ~10,000 K with variable emitting area, which doesn't capture realistic flare behavior supported by solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies.

Method: Proposes a physically motivated approach with constant emitting area but time-dependent temperature evolution, using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid rather than assuming an ad-hoc constant temperature value.

Result: Method reduces systematic errors by factors up to ten compared to previous estimates, demonstrated on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares. Works particularly well for K4 and later main-sequence stars with known effective temperatures.

Conclusion: Incorporating time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures provides more accurate flare energy estimates, offering a practical solution for single-band observations while improving physical realism.

Abstract: We present a new method for estimating the total energy radiated by stellar flares in broad-band continua, which assumes a constant emitting area but incorporates a time-dependent temperature evolution. This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000\,K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000\,K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates. We proved this on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares.

### [12] [A mapping method of age estimation for binary stars: Application to the $α$ Centauri system A and B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08879)
*F. Thévenin,V. A. Baturin,A. V. Oreshina,P. Morel,S. V. Ayukov,L. Bigot,A. B. Gorshkov*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Inverse calibration method applied to α Centauri binary system yields ages of 7.8±0.6 Ga (high solar Z/X) or 8.7±0.6 Ga (low solar Z/X), with mass errors causing ±0.6 Ga uncertainty and overshooting increasing age by 0.6-2.1 Ga.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve stellar models for accurate age determination using Gaia and PLATO mission data by developing methods to estimate system ages and initial chemical compositions from binary star observations.

Method: Applied inverse calibration method to α Centauri A and B binary system, assuming shared age and initial composition. Used observed luminosities, radii, and surface compositions to determine age, initial helium (Y_ini), heavy elements (Z_ini), and convective mixing-length parameters (α_A, α_B). Compared two solar Z/X ratio assumptions (0.0245 high vs 0.0181 low).

Result: For high solar Z/X=0.0245: age=7.8±0.6 Ga, Y_ini=0.284±0.004, Z_ini=0.0335±0.0015. For low solar Z/X=0.0181: age=8.7±0.6 Ga, Y_ini=0.267±0.008, Z_ini=0.025±0.002. Mass errors of ±0.002 cause age uncertainty of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of 0.05-0.20H_p increases age by 0.6-2.1 Ga. Models with higher Z/X and radiative cores (7.2-7.8 Ga) show better agreement with asteroseismic frequencies.

Conclusion: The inverse calibration method successfully determines ages and initial compositions for binary systems. Higher Z/X models with radiative cores (7.2-7.8 Ga range) are preferred due to better agreement with asteroseismic observations, demonstrating the method's utility for precise stellar age determination in the era of Gaia and PLATO data.

Abstract: Given the wealth of data provided by Gaia and the upcoming PLATO mission, it is essential to improve stellar models to obtain accurate stellar ages. Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($α_A $ and $α_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $α$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies.

### [13] [Discovery of a double white dwarf in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08898)
*Fabian Göttgens,Marilyn Latour,Ulrich Heber,Sebastian Kamann,Kyle Kremer,Sven Martens,Stefan Dreizler*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Discovery of a compact binary system of two white dwarfs in globular cluster NGC 6397, with one being an extremely low-mass He-core WD and the companion likely another WD or neutron star, possibly forming a triple system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binaries in globular cluster cores prevent gravitational collapse, and simulations predict many white dwarfs in NGC 6397's core, many in binary systems. This study aims to characterize the binary population in NGC 6397's center.

Method: Used MUSE radial-velocity survey to observe system NF1. Conducted spectral analysis to determine effective temperature and surface gravity. Fitted spectral energy distribution using HST magnitudes in various filters to determine mass. Analyzed orbital parameters from radial velocity measurements.

Result: Discovered a compact binary with: 1) Primary WD: Teff=16000 K, log g=5.72, mass=0.23±0.03 Msun (extremely low-mass He-core WD); 2) Circular orbit with period=0.54 days; 3) Radial velocity semi-amplitude=200 km/s implying minimum companion mass=0.78 Msun (likely another WD or neutron star if inclination <50°); 4) Residuals suggest possible triple system.

Conclusion: NF1 is a compact binary system containing an extremely low-mass He-core WD with a massive companion, likely another WD or neutron star. Residual radial velocities suggest possible triple system, requiring additional measurements for confirmation.

Abstract: Binaries in the cores of globular clusters are known to prevent the gravitational collapse of the cluster, and simulations predict that the core of NGC 6397 contains a large number of white dwarfs (WDs), of which many are expected to be part of a binary system. In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.

### [14] [Is the nitrogen-rich source PN K4-47 a true planetary nebula?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08959)
*Thomas Steinmetz,Tomasz Kaminski,David Jones,Marcin Hajduk,Denise R. Goncalves,Stavros Akras*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: PN K4-47 is confirmed as a genuine but unusual planetary nebula with bipolar outflows, molecular richness, and evidence of shock excitation, originating from a 4-6 M⊙ AGB progenitor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether PN K4-47 is a typical planetary nebula or an exotic object, given its unique characteristics including shock-excited bipolar lobes and the highest molecular diversity among planetary nebulae.

Method: Multi-wavelength observational approach using optical imaging and spectroscopy, sub-millimetre interferometry, and radio interferometry to spatially resolve the environment and analyze physical properties.

Result: Spatially resolved CO (2-1) emission aligned with optical outflow; distance ≤6 kpc; fast bipolar optical outflow (~350 km/s) and slow molecular outflow (~50-60 km/s); age ~336±119 yr; progenitor mass 4-6 M⊙ (WD mass ~1 M⊙); dust mass ~10⁻² M⊙; shock heating required beyond photoionization.

Conclusion: K4-47 is classified as a genuine planetary nebula, albeit unusual, originating from a J-type carbon AGB star with subsequent bipolar outflow shaping the circumstellar environment through shocks.

Abstract: PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.

*J. Bruce,E. Vesperini,A. Askar,E. Bortolan,M. Giersz,J. Hong,A. Hypki,A. P. Milone*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Monte Carlo simulations reveal distinct binary evolution in globular clusters with multiple stellar populations, showing P2 binaries experience more hardening/disruption, mixed binaries form dynamically, and binaries retain initial configuration memory longer than single stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the complex dynamical environment in globular clusters with multiple stellar populations influences binary star evolution, which in turn affects cluster evolution, given that binaries can serve as tracers of initial conditions and dynamical history.

Method: Used Monte Carlo simulations with the MOCCA code to investigate long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations (P1 and P2), analyzing global binary properties, spatial distributions, and formation mechanisms.

Result: P2 binaries experience increased hardening and disruption rates due to central concentration; binaries retain memory of initial configurations longer than single stars; mixed binaries form primarily in cores through dynamical interactions; main sequence-white dwarf binaries are more prevalent in P1.

Conclusion: Binaries serve as valuable tracers of cluster initial conditions and dynamical evolution, with distinct evolutionary pathways between populations highlighting the interplay between cluster dynamics and binary evolution in multi-population globular clusters.

Abstract: The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.

*Kyla Mullaney,Kelly E. Whalen,Jenna Cann,Kimberly Weaver,Jeffrey McKaig,Sara Doan*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of NGC 1365 using MUSE IFU, JWST, and Chandra data reveals unexpectedly high ionization regions in star-forming arms, potentially driven by shock heating, constraining AGN vs. star formation feedback impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AGN and star formation feedback processes heat and remove gas from galaxies, quenching star formation and shaping galaxy evolution, by studying their complex signatures in nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365.

Method: Combined analysis of archival MUSE/VLT integral field unit data (optical) with JWST and Chandra observations to map emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics across ~40 kpc scales at high spatial resolution.

Result: Identified a region of unexpectedly high ionization (BPT-identified) relative to surrounding star-forming arms; shock heating appears to play a significant role in this ionization enhancement.

Conclusion: The analysis provides constraints on the relative impact of AGN versus star formation processes on star-forming gas in NGC 1365, informing understanding of feedback's global impacts on galaxy populations.

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.

### [17] [The stellar velocity anisotropy of strong lensing massive elliptical galaxies and its role in the inference of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ using spatially resolved kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07159)
*Vishal Verma,Quinn Minor*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Joint strong lensing and kinematics modeling with appropriate anisotropy models yields sub-percent bias in H₀ measurements, while the Osipkov-Merritt model produces significant systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hubble Tension requires independent H₀ measurements, with strong lensing time-delay cosmography being promising but limited by mass-sheet degeneracy. Kinematic data helps break this degeneracy but introduces its own bias from unknown stellar velocity anisotropy.

Method: Analyzed ten massive elliptical galaxies from Illustris TNG100 simulations, generating mock JWST NIRSpec-like velocity-dispersion maps. Tested four anisotropy models (Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Lokas, constant β, generalized-OM) under kinematics-only and joint kinematics+strong lensing analyses.

Result: Joint modeling yields sub-percent average H₀ bias: +0.2±1.6% (ML), -0.9±1.9% (constant), -0.9±1.6% (gOM) with ~5% scatter. OM model produces large systematic biases: +11.5±1.3% with joint modeling, and >20% errors with kinematics-only data. gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and most accurate H₀ relative to posterior uncertainties.

Conclusion: Anisotropy model choice critically impacts H₀ inference in galaxy dynamics. Joint modeling reduces bias and improves precision, with gOM performing best. OM model produces unacceptable systematic biases unlikely to average out across galaxy ensembles, highlighting the importance of appropriate anisotropy assumptions.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in cosmology, the Hubble Tension, requires independent measurements of $H_0$, and strong lensing with time-delay cosmography is a promising avenue. The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \pm 1.6\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \pm 1.9\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \pm 1.6\%$ (gOM), with $\sim 5\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \pm 1.3\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.

*Roberto Flores,Elena Fantino,Giuseppina Battaglia,Antonio Aparicio*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Researchers created a catalog of massive main sequence stars in metal-poor dwarf galaxy Sextans A using HST UV photometry and MIST stellar tracks with Finite Element interpolation to estimate stellar properties and uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically identify and characterize massive stars in low-metallicity environments to improve understanding of early evolutionary stages of massive metal-poor stars, which are important for stellar evolution models and galaxy formation studies.

Method: Used HST WFC3 UV photometry (275nm and 336nm filters) to create Color-Magnitude Diagrams, overlaid with MIST stellar evolutionary tracks. Applied Finite Element interpolation (originally from solid mechanics) to compute stellar properties (mass, age) and their gradients with respect to photometry for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Catalog contains 655 massive stars (>8 M☉) with most massive at 58±11 M☉. Comparison with ground-based spectroscopy shows only 8 matches, indicating minimal overlap. Mass estimates from UV CMD and spectral classification agree well for O-type stars found in both datasets.

Conclusion: The catalog provides extensive candidate list for followup spectroscopic observations to advance understanding of massive low-metallicity star evolution. The Finite Element method proves effective for stellar property interpolation and uncertainty estimation in complex parameter spaces.

Abstract: We build a catalog of massive (M>$8~$M$_\odot$) main sequence stars in the \mbox{metal-poor} ($\sim0.1~$Z$_\odot$) dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A. HST WFC3 UV photometry in the 275 and 336 nm wideband filters is arranged in a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD), and overlaid on top of stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST library. The star properties (mass, age, etc.) are computed with a Finite Element (FE) interpolation of the stellar tracks. The FE method, originally developed for solid mechanics problems, provides a general framework for interpolating fields inside domains of complex geometry. Besides the interpolated properties, the algorithm computes their gradients with respect to the photometry. These sensitivities provide a direct an efficient estimate of the associated uncertainties. Our catalog contains 655 stars, with the most massive one estimated at $58\pm11~$M$_\odot$. A comparison with a ground-based spectroscopic census of OB stars yields only 8 matches, evidencing the minimal overlap between both datasets. The mass estimates derived from the UV CMD and the spectral classification are in good agreement for the majority of O-type stars found in both datasets. Our catalog provides an extensive list of candidates for followup spectroscopic observation, which could improve our understanding of the early evolutionary stages of massive \mbox{low-metallicity} stars.

### [19] [Properties of Galactic Outflows Driven by Starburst at Cosmic Noon: Insights from Hydrodynamical Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07592)
*Huan Chen,Weishan Zhu,Xue-Fu Li,Tian-Rui Wang,Antonios Katsianis,Long-Long Feng*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: High-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations of starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon reveal strong temporal and spatial variations in outflow properties, with cool phase dominance and mass loading factors that decrease with stellar mass but increase with star formation rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies during cosmic noon (peak of cosmic star formation) and investigate discrepancies between different simulation suites and observations regarding outflow properties and scaling relations.

Method: High-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that reproduces multiphase outflows in M82, applied to galaxies with stellar masses 9.0 < log(M*/M⊙) < 10.0, tracking starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr and analyzing outflow properties across different phases (cool: 8000 < T ≤ 2×10⁴ K, warm).

Result: Outflows show velocities of 50-1000 km/s, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M⊙/yr, and mass loading factors (η_M) of 0.24-6.26. Cool phase dominates outflow properties. Average η_M at M* = 10^9.5 M⊙: ~1.2 (total), 0.75 (cool), 0.25 (warm). η_M decreases with stellar mass but increases with SFR. Simulations show 0.06 dex higher η_M than FIRE-2 but 0.50-0.84 dex lower than EAGLE and TNG50.

Conclusion: Strong temporal and spatial evolution means scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated cautiously. Methodological differences in outflow measurement account for 0.2-0.4 dex of simulation discrepancies, suggesting inconsistent definitions contribute to literature disagreements. Larger samples with consistent measurement methods are needed for robust scaling relations.

Abstract: We investigate starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies ($9.0 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10.0$) at cosmic noon using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that can reproduce the multiphase outflows in M82. The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Outflow properties vary strongly with time, radial distance to galaxy center, stellar mass, and gas fraction, exhibiting velocities of 50-1000 $\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factors, $η_\mathrm{M}$, of 0.24-6.26. The cool phase ($8000 < T \le 2 \times 10^4$ K) dominates the outflow, and properties of the cool and warm phases are broadly consistent with observations. At $M_*= 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, average $η_\mathrm{M}$ for the total, cool, and warm phases are $\sim$1.2, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. The mass loading factor decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass, but increases with star formation rate. Given strong temporal and spatial evolution, scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated with caution. Our total $η_\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.

Motivation: LSB structures reveal galaxy mass assembly history, but systematic uncertainties limit detectable surface brightness levels. Despite decades of advancements, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains challenging, hindering exploration of the LSB universe.

Method: Development of the novel K-DRIFT telescope with specifications designed for LSB detection.

Conclusion: K-DRIFT represents a breakthrough approach to exploring the LSB universe, overcoming current observational limitations. By enabling ultra-deep optical observations and combining with other surveys, it will provide profound insights into galaxy evolution through LSB structure analysis and star formation studies in low-density regions.

Abstract: Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures serve as evidence of the intricate mass assembly of galaxies, and dedicatedly studying them promises to give us profound insights into the evolutionary history of galaxies. Furthermore, delving into the properties of star formation (SF) in the LSB regime can broaden our understanding of SF activity in regions characterized by low surface gas density, thereby shedding light on fundamental cosmic processes. However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies. To further advance the capabilities of the K-DRIFT survey, focused on LSB detection, we present several feasible research topics that utilize other survey data together and discuss the role of LSB observation in understanding the evolution of galaxies.

TL;DR: Multi-wavelength study reveals optical bimodality in RXCJ0110.0+1358 is projection effect from filament contamination, not rotation; weak lensing shows mass concentrated in southeast, resolving discrepancy between optical and X-ray views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the apparent contradiction between optical data showing bimodal galaxy distribution with kinematic substructure (suggesting rotation) and X-ray data showing smooth, single-component emission in cluster RXCJ0110.0+1358.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis combining deep CFHT imaging, SDSS photometry, spectroscopic redshifts, XMM-Newton X-ray observations, and weak lensing analysis to determine true mass distribution and resolve optical/X-ray discrepancy.

Result: Weak lensing reveals mass concentrated in southeast (log M200/M⊙ = 14.04+0.24-0.40), while northwestern substructure has negligible mass (~10^13 M⊙); optical bimodality arises from projection of filament contaminating galaxy membership, creating spurious substructure mimicking rotation.

Conclusion: The apparent optical rotation signal is an artifact of projection effects from filament contamination, not true dynamical rotation; this resolves inconsistencies between optical and X-ray observations and demonstrates importance of multi-wavelength analysis for accurate cluster characterization.

Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster RXCJ0110.0+1358 ($z=0.058$), a rotating cluster candidate, combining deep CFHT imaging, SDSS photometry, spectroscopic redshifts, and XMM-Newton X-ray observations. We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\log M_{200}/M_\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_\odot$). This immense mass disparity rules out the dynamical possibility of a rotating system. We demonstrate that the apparent optical bimodality arises from the projection of a filament, which led optical group-finding algorithms to misclassify these galaxies as cluster members. This contamination creates a spurious substructure that mimics a rotation signal and leads to an overestimation of the luminosity-based halo mass, resolving the observed inconsistencies.

Motivation: To provide high-resolution, wide-frequency coverage radio survey data of the southern Galactic Plane for studying Galactic and extragalactic sources.

Method: Combined GLEAM-X observations (MWA Phase-II extended configuration) with previous GLEAM survey data to achieve sensitivity across spatial scales (45''-15°), performed source-finding on wide-band image (170-231 MHz).

Result: Produced images across 72-231 MHz frequency range and catalog of 98,207 sources with 90% completeness at 50-125 mJy and 99.3% reliability, with RMS noise of 3-6 mJy/beam and 1 arcsecond position accuracy.

Conclusion: The third GLEAM-X data release provides comprehensive radio survey data of the southern Galactic Plane with improved sensitivity and spatial coverage, enabling detailed studies of Galactic and extragalactic radio sources.

Abstract: We present the third data release for the Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, covering = 3800 deg2 of the southern Galactic Plane (GP) with \ang{233} < l < \ang{44} and |b| < \ang{11} across a frequency range of 72 - 231 MHz divided into 20 sub-bands. GLEAM-X observations were taken using the "extended" Phase-II configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which features baselines ranging from approximately 12 m to 5 km. This configuration limits sensitivity to the diffuse structure of the GP, with an angular resolution range of about 45'' to 2'. To achieve lower noise levels while being sensitive to a wide range of spatial scales (45''- \ang{15}), we combined these observations with the previous Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. For the area covered, we provide images spanning the whole frequency range. A wide-band image over 170 - 231 MHz, with RMS noise of = 3 - 6 mJy/beam and source position accuracy within 1 arcseconds, is then used to perform source-finding, which yields 98,207 elements measured across 20 x 7.68 MHz frequency bands. The catalogue is 90% complete at 50 mJy within \ang{233} < l < \ang{324} and at 125 mJy in \ang{290} < l < \ang{44}, while it is 99.3% reliable overall. All the images and the catalogue are available online for download.

### [24] [An unusual pair of interstellar HI features and a related white dwarf star inside the HI cavity surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08756)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Two mysterious HI structures near a white dwarf may be remnants of a 300,000-year-old planetary nebula that expanded into a cavity, preserving its morphology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the origin of two mysterious unresolved HI structures (+12 and -6 km/s) discovered near a faint white dwarf star, which exist within a large HI cavity surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association.

Method: Analysis of high-resolution 21-cm survey data revealing HI morphology in the region, examination of the cavity structure, and comparison with theoretical models of planetary nebula evolution and cooling timescales.

Result: The HI features and filamentary structure appear to be remnants of a planetary nebula approximately 300,000 years old that has cooled to neutral gas emitting the 21-cm line, preserved due to expansion into a low-density cavity.

Conclusion: The mysterious HI structures likely represent a cooled planetary nebula remnant that maintained its original morphology by expanding into a cavity relatively devoid of interstellar gas, preventing absorption of its traces.

Abstract: Two mysterious unresolved HI structures at velocities of +12 and -6 km/s were discovered in high resolution 21-cm survey data in the direction of a faint white dwarf star. Examination of the HI morphology in this area of sky shows that the star and HI features exists in a large cavity in interstellar HI surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association. The cavity may have been created by an ancient supernova. It is hypothesized that the pair of HI features and filamentary HI structure found in its immediate vicinity may be the remnants of a planetary nebula some 3 x 10^5 years old that have cooled to the point that the gas is neutral and emitting the 21-cm spectral line. This remnant has maintained the morphological characteristics of the original planetary nebula because it expanded into a volume of space relatively devoid of interstellar gas that would otherwise have absorbed any traces of the original nebula.
