While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons.

However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation.

GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\\rm \\dot{J}$). We then compared $\\rm \\dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\\rm \\dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength.

Accepted in A&A", "summary": "The accretion process in young stellar objects (YSOs) is fundamental to the formation of stellar systems. This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock.
