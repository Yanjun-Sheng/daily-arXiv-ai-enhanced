### [1] [Constraining the Lifespan of Intelligent Technological Civilization in the Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22252)
*Sohrab Rahvar,Shahin Rouhani*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The Fermi paradox imposes constraints on the lifespan of technological civilizations: if intelligent life is common, civilizations must be short-lived (≲5×10³ years) to explain the absence of contact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Fermi paradox by exploring constraints on the emergence and longevity of technologically intelligent civilizations in our Galaxy, given the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations.

Method: Analyze constraints under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, considering that the absence of contact imposes limits on civilization lifespans. Use the fact that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past ∼10⁵ years.

Result: If intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to ≲5×10³ years under the most optimistic scenario. The lack of detected electromagnetic signals is particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations given our light cone covers the past ∼10⁵ years of Galactic history.

Conclusion: The Fermi paradox imposes upper bounds on the lifespan of technological civilizations, suggesting they must be short-lived if intelligent life is common. These results should be interpreted as constraints derived from the paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.

Abstract: In this work, we explore constraints on the emergence and longevity of technologically intelligent civilizations in our Galaxy, considering the Fermi paradox. We argue that under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations imposes limits on their lifespan. Our analysis suggests that if intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to $\lesssim 5\times10^3$ years under our most optimistic scenario. Considering electromagnetic communication, we note that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past $\sim 10^5$ years, making the lack of detected signals particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations. We emphasize that these results should be interpreted as upper bounds derived from the Fermi paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.

### [2] [Gaia DR3 Analysis of Four Open Clusters Toward the Galactic Anticenter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22304)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Detailed analysis of four open clusters (COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, UBC 74) using Gaia DR3 data reveals they are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters at 1-3.5 kpc from Sun, following nearly circular orbits typical of thin-disc populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of four open clusters located opposite the Galactic center, using them as tracers of the Galactic thin disc's chemical and dynamical evolution.

Method: Used Gaia DR3 astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data; applied UPMASK algorithm in 5D parameter space for membership determination; fitted King profiles for structural parameters; performed Bayesian MCMC isochrone fitting with PARSEC models; conducted SED analysis with ARIADNE; computed Galactic orbits with galpy.

Result: Identified 116-387 members per cluster; derived extinctions, distances (1-3.5 kpc), metallicities, and ages; found clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits; calculated dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr, which are exceeded by cluster ages, indicating dynamically evolved systems.

Conclusion: These open clusters are dynamically evolved systems that serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc, with their properties consistent with typical thin-disc populations.

Abstract: This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.

### [3] [You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22305)
*Alessandro Trinca,Alessandro Lupi,Francesco Haardt,Piero Madau*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST high-z AGNs show X-ray weakness due to confined coronae in super-Eddington funnels, leading to bimodal mass solutions favoring low-mass (~10⁶-10⁷ M⊙) black holes accreting at f_Edd ≫ 1 rather than overmassive black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST to resolve discrepancies between single-epoch virial estimators and observed X-ray properties, particularly extreme X-ray weakness and non-detections in deep Chandra imaging.

Method: Joint analysis of broad emission lines and Chandra non-detections using self-shadowed super-Eddington accretion flow framework with coronal over-cooling prescription. Couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra and explore parameter space through full MCMC inference on JWST AGN sample.

Result: Analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, low-Eddington black holes (disfavored) or low-mass (~10⁶-10⁷ M⊙) black holes accreting at f_Edd ≫ 1 (strongly preferred). The latter solution returns masses consistent with or lower than local M_BH-M_star relations, mitigating extreme mass ratios. Predicted spectra are redder with reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities.

Conclusion: Many JWST broad-line AGNs at z ≳ 6 are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes in single-epoch virial estimates.

Abstract: We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \gtrsim 6$.

TL;DR: CEERS NIRCam galaxy morphology catalog with Sérsic fits in six filters, comparing to CANDELS, studying size-mass evolution to z~9 and color gradients at 1<z<5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive public catalog of morphological parameters for galaxies in CEERS NIRCam imaging, enabling studies of galaxy evolution to high redshifts (z~10) and comparing JWST measurements with previous HST results.

Method: Used galfit to fit 53,885 galaxies (F356W<28.5) in six NIRCam broadband filters (F115W-F444W), measuring Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle. Estimated uncertainties using simulated galaxies with similar noise/background properties.

Result: Catalog shows good agreement with CANDELS/EGS HST measurements (size agreement within 0.09 dex, Sérsic indices within 0.13 dex). Size-mass evolution to z~9 consistent with lower-redshift results. Color gradients show mass dependence for late-types (n<2.5) but no redshift evolution, while early-types (n>2.5) have flat gradients.

Conclusion: The CEERS morphological catalog provides accurate structural measurements (20% or better for F356W<27.0 mag) enabling detailed studies of galaxy morphology to z~10, revealing insights into stellar population gradients and morphological k-corrections.

Abstract: We present measurements of morphological parameters from fitting 53,885 galaxies detected to a magnitude limit of F356W$< 28.5$ in the CEERS NIRCam imaging with galfit in six broadband filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1<z<5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n<2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n>2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout. The structural measurements presented are accurate to $20\%$ or better for most galaxies with F356W $<27.0$ mag and will enable further studies of galaxy morphology to $z\sim10$.

TL;DR: DLEIY is a galactic chemical evolution model that uses observed star formation histories and metallicity distributions to constrain supernova yields and galactic outflows in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, revealing discrepancies in Mg yields and Type Ia supernova rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical abundances in stellar populations encode nucleosynthesis information but are confounded by galaxy-specific star formation histories, making empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing challenging.

Method: Introduces DLEIY galactic chemical evolution model that uses observed star formation histories and metallicity distributions to reduce confounding factors. Applies joint statistical model to dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax to simultaneously constrain population-averaged yields and galactic outflows without fixing absolute nucleosynthetic yield scales.

Result: Fe yield from core collapse supernovae consistent with theoretical models, but Mg yield is 2-4 times higher, corroborating previous suggestions of under-predicted [Mg/Fe]. Type Ia supernova rate enhanced by factor of ~5 relative to field galaxies, with delay-time distribution following ~t^{-2} (steeper than supernova survey measurement of ~t^{-1.1}).

Conclusion: DLEIY successfully constrains supernova yields and outflows in dwarf galaxies, revealing significant discrepancies in Mg yields and Type Ia supernova properties, suggesting possible metallicity dependence of Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution.

Abstract: The chemical abundances of a stellar population encode information about nucleosynthesis and its astrophysical sites, but this information is confounded by the specific star formation history of the host galaxy. As a result, placing empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing using abundances has been very challenging. We introduce a galactic chemical evolution model DLEIY that uses an observed star formation history and metallicity distribution to reduce these confounding factors. Using a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows are achieved with DLEIY, without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields. The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, corroborating previous suggestions that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe]. We also find that the rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, and the delay-time distribution goes as $\sim t^{-2}$, a much steeper relationship than that measured from supernova surveys ($\sim t^{-1.1}$). These findings may suggest a metallicity dependence of the Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST/MIRI detects crystalline CO₂ ice and cold gas-phase CO₂ in the dusty torus of planetary nebula NGC 6302, challenging assumptions about ice survival in harsh UV environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether fragile molecular ices can survive in the intense UV radiation environment of planetary nebulae, specifically testing the shielding capacity of dusty tori in evolved stellar systems.

Method: Used JWST/MIRI observations to analyze infrared spectra along sightlines through the dusty torus of planetary nebula NGC 6302, examining CO₂ absorption features and their profiles.

Result: Detected both crystalline CO₂ ice (showing characteristic double-peak absorption profile) and cold gas-phase CO₂ (20-50 K) in the dusty torus. The CO₂ gas-to-ice ratio is >10× higher than in young stellar objects.

Conclusion: The dusty torus provides sufficient shielding for ice chemistry despite intense UV radiation, requiring ice-mediated surface reactions to be incorporated into planetary nebula chemical models. The distinct gas-to-ice ratio suggests different ice formation/processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments.

Abstract: Using JWST/MIRI observations, we report the detection of CO$_2$ ice in the dusty torus of the planetary nebula NGC 6302, an environment generally considered hostile to fragile molecular species and ices due to intense UV irradiation. This detection accompanies cold (20-50 K) gas-phase CO$_2$ along the same sightlines. The ice absorption profile exhibits a double-peak profile, a characteristic of pure, crystalline CO$_2$ ice. The CO$_2$ gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments. This discovery demonstrates that the dusty torus provides sufficient shielding to harbour ice chemistry, and that ice-mediated surface reactions must be incorporated into chemical models of planetary nebulae.

TL;DR: ML approach automates classification of molecular clumps using MALT90 survey data, identifying evolutionary stages through unsupervised clustering and supervised classification of uncertain sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification of molecular clumps based on human-assigned IR categories leaves many sources unclassified due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties, or obscured IR emission. A data-driven approach is needed to complement existing methods.

Method: Applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities from MALT90 survey (HCO⁺, HNC, N₂H⁺, HCN, C₂H) complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. Used supervised learning to classify previously uncertain clumps.

Result: Identified stable clusters corresponding to evolutionary stages: protostars and regions without active star formation (driven by C₂H and N₂H⁺ emission). Adding H¹³CO⁺ revealed UV-dominant cluster tracing evolved regions. IR properties were non-significant features. Classified 522 uncertain objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation.

Conclusion: ML techniques effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional classification methods.

Abstract: The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods.

### [8] [3D-Herschel: Constraining Dust Emission with Panchromatic Modeling of 3D-HST Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22384)
*Seamus McNulty,Mimi Song,Katherine E. Whitaker,Joel Leja,Aubrey Medrano,Elijah P. Mathews,Mark Dickinson,Hanae Inami,Ivo Labbe,Danilo Marchesini,Alexandra Pope,Irene Shivaei*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 3D-Herschel combines deblended Herschel FIR data with CANDELS/3D-HST to study dust-obscured galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5. UV-MIR-only models recover robust stellar properties for FIR-detected galaxies, but FIR constraints reveal evolving MIR-to-IR ratios dependent on stellar mass and warmer dust temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better characterize dust-obscured galaxies in the distant universe by combining deblended Herschel far-infrared imaging with optical/near-infrared data from CANDELS/3D-HST, addressing limitations of UV-MIR-only modeling and understanding dust emission properties.

Method: Created 3D-Herschel catalog (0.3-350μm) combining deblended Herschel FIR data with CANDELS/3D-HST. Used Prospector-β (17-parameter Bayesian fitting code) to model 41,387 galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5. Compared fits with and without FIR constraints, analyzing stellar/dust properties with realistic error bars.

Result: For FIR-detected galaxies (3.2% with >3σ in ≥2 Herschel bands), UV-MIR-only models recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and masses (50-70% within median 1σ error). Star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset (0.1±0.07 dex). FIR-inclusive fits yield ~7K warmer dust temperatures at all redshifts and ~0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7μm ratios at low-mass end (log(M⋆)~9.6 M⊙), revealing MIR-to-IR conversion dependence on stellar mass.

Conclusion: MIR-to-IR luminosity conversions depend on stellar mass, cautioning against using LIR-independent templates without FIR data. For galaxies with <10¹¹ M⊙ at z>1.5, Herschel provides only upper limits due to source confusion; next-generation FIR telescopes are essential for fully characterizing dust emission in distant galaxies.

Abstract: We present 3D-Herschel, a new 0.3-350$μ$m photometric catalog that combines deblended Herschel far-infrared (FIR) imaging with the CANDELS/3D-HST legacy fields to probe the dust-obscured universe. Using the 17-parameter fitting code Prospector-$β$, a Bayesian inference framework, we model 41,387 galaxies spanning 0.5 $< z <$ 2.5 to measure stellar and dust properties with realistic error bars. Comparing fits with and without FIR constraints, we find that for the 3.2$\%$ of galaxies with $>3 σ$ detections in at least two Herschel bands, UV-MIR-only models (0.3-24$μ$m) recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and stellar masses (50-70$\%$ within the median 1$σ$ error). Consequently, the star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset, with an average deviation of 0.1$\pm$0.07 dex at fixed stellar mass for FIR-detected sources at all redshifts. However, the use of rigid log-average IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters ($γ$, $U_{\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\mathrm{PAH}}$) in UV-MIR modeling corresponds to an unevolving MIR-to-IR luminosity ratio and cold dust temperatures. By contrast, fits that include Herschel photometry, with added freedom in the FIR, yield dust temperatures that are $\sim$7K warmer at all redshifts, with $\sim$0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7$μ$m luminosity ratios at the low-mass end of a Herschel-detected sample (log($M_{\star}$) $\sim$9.6 $M_{\odot}$). These results demonstrate that MIR-to-IR conversions depend on stellar mass, cautioning against $L_{\mathrm{IR}}$-independent templates without FIR data. For galaxies with $<10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z>1.5$, even with state-of-the-art analysis, Herschel can at best provide upper limits due to source confusion; next-generation FIR telescopes will be essential to fully characterize dust emission in distant galaxies.

### [9] [Little Red Dots as Obscured Little Blue Dots: A Super-Eddington Unification Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22386)
*Piero Madau,Roberto Maiolino*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: LRDs are high-inclination, dust-reddened counterparts of compact blue AGNs (LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion, unified via orientation effects in a geometrically thick accretion flow model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether Little Red Dots (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination versions of compact blue broad-line AGNs (Little Blue Dots, LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion, and to unify their observables through orientation effects.

Method: Model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow producing anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua. Use inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy radiative transfer code to simulate spectral properties. Include an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor.

Result: The model reproduces extreme broad Hα equivalent widths of JWST LRDs with global BLR covering factors of only 15%. Large Balmer EWs arise from self-shadowing suppressing high-inclination optical continuum while BLR is illuminated by EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines result from orientation-dependent suppression of XUV/soft X-ray continuum. With AV = 2.8 attenuation, the model matches V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements.

Conclusion: LRDs and LBDs are unified via orientation in super-Eddington accretion systems. The model explains diverse observables including Hα EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission through inclination effects without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous cocoon.

Abstract: We test whether "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs ("Little Blue Dots", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.

TL;DR: Hubble Space Telescope observations identify Cepheid variables in two AGN host galaxies (NGC 4303 and NGC 1068) to measure precise distances using the period-luminosity relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish accurate distances to two canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN) using Cepheid variable stars as standard candles, which is crucial for understanding AGN properties, black hole masses, and cosmological studies.

Method: Used HST observations with F555W and F814W filters over 12 visits per target with nonredundant time spacing. Identified point sources, selected Cepheid candidates based on periodicity, and applied period-luminosity relation calibrated with LMC geometric distance (Riess et al. 2019). Corrected for metallicity effects and used LMC distance constraint from Pietrzyński et al. (2019).

Result: Found 130 Cepheid candidates (periods 13-93 days) in NGC 4303 and 51 candidates (periods 14-92 days) in NGC 1068. Derived distance moduli: μ = 31.083 ± 0.035 mag for NGC 4303 (D = 16.47 ± 0.27 Mpc) and μ = 30.150 ± 0.106 mag for NGC 1068 (D = 10.72 ± 0.52 Mpc).

Conclusion: Successfully measured precise distances to two important AGN host galaxies using Cepheid variables, providing reliable distance anchors for AGN studies and contributing to the cosmic distance ladder with sub-5% precision.

Abstract: We present Cepheid-based distances to two canonical AGN: NGC 4303 (M 61) and NGC 1068. Data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope with nonredundant time spacing over 12 visits for each target, and observations were made with the F555W and F814W filters. We found 32,694 point sources in NGC 4303, and 130 of these were determined to be strong Cepheid candidates with periods ranging ~$13-93$ days. In NGC 1068, we found 20,207 point sources, where 51 of these were strong Cepheid candidates with periods ~$14-92$ days. We fit the period$-$luminosity relationship, calibrated based on a geometric distance to the LMC by Riess et al. (2019), to our Cepheid candidates in each galaxy and correct for potential effects of metallicity. Using a distance constraint for the LMC given by Pietrzyński et al. (2019), this yields a distance modulus of $μ= 31.083 \pm 0.035$ mag for NGC 4303 and $μ= 30.150 \pm 0.106$ mag for NGC 1068. Thus, we measure distances of $D = 16.47 \pm 0.27$ Mpc to NGC 4303 and $D = 10.72 \pm 0.52$ Mpc to NGC 1068.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Dust-rich regions in group-centered elliptical galaxies show dust clouds in hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback, with molecular gas preferentially at X-ray cavity rims, indicating AGN-driven outflows enhance cold gas condensation. Dust extinction properties reveal smaller dust grains in mixed-phase environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in group-centered elliptical galaxies, focusing on their connection with hot X-ray gas and detailed dust grain characteristics, particularly how AGN feedback influences dust and gas properties.

Method: Comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis using H-alpha and CO emission data from MUSE and ALMA, combined with X-ray imaging to study dust clouds embedded in hot X-ray atmospheres, examining spatial relationships between dust, molecular gas, and X-ray structures.

Result: Dust regions with molecular gas (traced by CO) are preferentially located at rims of X-ray cavities, suggesting AGN-driven outflows enhance condensation of cold, dusty gas. Molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically linked. Spatial variations in extinction ratio Rv show smaller values (steeper extinction curves) where dust, CO, and H-alpha coincide, indicating smaller/less evolved dust grains in mixed-phase environments.

Conclusion: AGN feedback creates compressive interfaces at X-ray cavity rims that enhance cold gas condensation, forming multiphase media. Dust grain properties vary spatially, with smaller grains dominating in mixed-phase environments where dust, molecular, and ionized gas coexist, suggesting different grain evolution processes in shielded versus exposed regions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.

### [12] [Cosmic Environment as the Primary Driver of Dwarf Satellite Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22485)
*Saeed Tavasoli,Parsa Ghafour*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Satellite galaxy abundance and distribution depend primarily on environment, with host stellar mass and cosmic time as secondary factors, showing distinct evolutionary pathways across cluster, group, and void environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite dwarf galaxies are crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host galaxy properties and large-scale environment. This study aims to quantify how satellite populations depend on host stellar mass, morphology, and star formation activity across different environments and trace their evolution over cosmic time within the ΛCDM framework.

Method: The study uses the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model to construct consistent samples of host galaxies (brighter than Mr < -16) and their satellites (M_* ≥ 3×10^5 M_sun, Mr < -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group, and void environments, with evolution traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins.

Result: Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass, while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0, radial profiles show strong central concentrations in voids, flattened distributions in clusters, and intermediate trends in groups. Redshift evolution reveals progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments, stability for massive hosts, and increasing central concentration in voids. Cosmic evolution of satellite abundance shows distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups, and strong late-time suppression in clusters.

Conclusion: The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment, with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.

Abstract: Context:Satellite dwarf galaxies provide key constraints on galaxy formation and evolution as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host properties and large-scale environment.
  Aims:This study quantifies the dependence of satellite populations on host stellar mass, morphology and star formation activity across diverse environments and traces their evolution with cosmic time within the LCDM framework.
  Methods:The Millennium simulation combined with the semi-analytic model is employed to construct consistent samples of host galaxies brighter than Mr < -16 and their satellites (M_* >= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr < -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group and void environments and their evolution is traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins.
  Results:Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0 radial profiles reveal strong central concentrations in voids flattened distributions in clusters and intermediate trends in groups. Their redshift evolution shows progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments stability for massive hosts and increasing central concentration in voids. The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance further highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups and strong late-time suppression in clusters.
  Conclusions:The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.

### [13] [VLBI Detections of Compact Nuclei in Spiral-hosted Double-lobed Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs): Evidence for Weak Parsec-Scale Jet Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22668)
*Mingyu Ryu,Jae-Young Kim*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: VLBI observations reveal compact radio nuclei and parsec-scale jets in four spiral-hosted radio-loud AGNs, showing low brightness temperatures and mildly relativistic speeds, suggesting weakly powered pc-scale outflows that coexist with large kpc-scale lobes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the rare class of spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs) that challenge the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical galaxies, and to understand the nature of their pc-scale jet properties.

Method: Used milliarcsecond-scale VLBI observations from public archives to detect compact radio nuclei and resolve parsec-scale jets in four spiral DRAGNs, analyzing brightness temperatures, jet-to-counterjet ratios, radio-Eddington ratios, and comparing with fundamental plane of black hole activity and GRMHD simulations.

Result: Identified compact cores in all four sources and resolved parsec-scale jets in two; found low brightness temperatures (~10^9 K in cores) and mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds (β≲0.6), with low radio-Eddington ratios (log(L_R/L_Edd) ≈ -5 to -8); three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity.

Conclusion: Spiral DRAGNs exhibit weakly powered pc-scale outflows with properties consistent with early or intermittently magnetized jet launching phases; the coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes suggests recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts, while maintaining similar accretion-jet coupling to other AGNs.

Abstract: We report milliarcsecond-scale VLBI detections of compact radio nuclei in four spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical hosts. Using public VLBI data archives, we identify compact cores in four sources and resolve parsec-scale jets in two of them. The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($β\lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $θ\lesssim 80^\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ViT-MDNz: A deep learning model that estimates redshifts and uncertainties from single-band galaxy images using Vision Transformers for morphology extraction and Mixture Density Networks for probability density prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of redshift estimation when only single-band images are available, leveraging morphological features as an alternative to multi-band photometric data.

Method: Integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features from single-band images and Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict full redshift probability density functions with uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves σ_NMAD = 0.034 and outlier fraction f_out = 2.6% in r-band for redshifts up to z ≲ 1 on DESI-LS data; PIT and CRPS evaluations confirm well-calibrated probability density functions.

Conclusion: Competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone; ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, enhancing completeness for future surveys like DESI and LSST.

Abstract: To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\rm out} = 2.6\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.

### [15] [A FUV - optical approach for studying hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies with UVIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22860)
*Sanal Ananthu,Gairola Shashank,Smitha Subramanian,Rao C. Jayanth,Shyam H. Menon,Chayan Mondal,Sreedevi Muraleedharan*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A semi-novel method using FUV-g color as an age indicator for star-forming clumps, validated on NGC 5457 and applied to NGC 1313, enabling hierarchical star formation analysis with UVIT FUV-only observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NUV channel of UVIT is not operational, but there are abundant archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. A method using FUV-g color as an alternative to FUV-NUV for age dating star-forming clumps is needed to leverage these existing datasets.

Method: Combined UVIT FUV data with g-band data from DECaLS to characterize star-forming clumps. Developed and optimized a method using FUV-g color as an age indicator, validated against FUV-NUV on NGC 5457. Used two-point correlation function to parametrize star formation hierarchy.

Result: FUV-g color proved equally reliable as FUV-NUV for age determination after proper background subtraction. Good agreement in hierarchy parameters derived from both color methods for NGC 5457. First constraint of global hierarchy parameter for NGC 1313 using FUV-g based ages.

Conclusion: The FUV-g method effectively constrains star-forming clump ages and enables investigation of hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using available FUV and optical observations, overcoming limitations of non-operational UVIT NUV channel.

Abstract: Young star-forming clumps (SFCs) emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV), making UV imaging ideal for detecting them. The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations.

TL;DR: Study of J1611+4026 triple galaxy system reveals ongoing major merger between two gas-rich companions, triggering minor rejuvenation in massive early-type host galaxy via gas accretion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish direct observational link between satellite galaxy interactions and rejuvenation of massive host galaxies, addressing challenges in understanding group pre-processing and interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis using DESI-LS optical imaging and DESI/P200 spectroscopy. Employed 2D morphological decomposition with GALIGHT and joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with BAGPIPES and CIGALE to deconstruct structural properties and star formation histories.

Result: Identified asymmetric tidal tail (~15.15 kpc) confirming ongoing major merger between companions A and B. Revealed minor rejuvenation in host galaxy C with significant dust extinction (E(B-V)~0.53), UV excess, and recent (~100 Myr) starburst contributing <0.1% to total stellar mass.

Conclusion: Group pre-processing occurs where satellite galaxy interactions drive low-level star formation in massive hosts through gas transfer, providing quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.

Abstract: Interactions within galaxy groups are fundamental drivers of galactic evolution, and establishing a direct observational link between the dynamical processes of satellite galaxies and the rejuvenation of massive host galaxies remains challenging. We present a multi-wavelength work of J1611+4026, a unique triple system characterised by a massive early-type host galaxy, Component C and two gas-rich companions, Components A and B, which are currently undergoing a major merger in its near environment. Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \textsc{BAGPIPES} and \textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of ``minor rejuvenation'', characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\rm burst} < 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions. These results strongly suggest group pre-processing, where interactions between satellite galaxies drive low-level star formation in the massive host through gas transfer, providing a quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A stochastic nonlinear oscillator framework for galactic evolution using a Hopf bifurcation to model transitions between quiescent and starburst states, with dark matter halo scatter as multiplicative noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal yet interpretable computational framework that links local feedback processes and global gravitational potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution patterns, capturing the complex interplay between gas density, star formation, and dark matter halo properties.

Method: Coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator model based on supercritical Hopf bifurcation for gas density (G) and star formation rate (S) co-evolution. Dark matter halo scatter modeled as multiplicative noise using Euler-Maruyama method. Radial reduction yields effective Fokker-Planck equation for burst amplitude. Includes differential shear Ω(r) and spatially varying bifurcation fields.

Result: Reveals periodic "Galactic Heartbeat" signature as deterministic limit cycle validated by resonance peak in star-formation spectrum. Stationary solution of Fokker-Planck equation matches numerical PDFs. Framework reproduces spiral morphologies, AGN-driven quenching, and "Red and Dead" cores via attractor collapse when growth parameter is sub-critical. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency.

Conclusion: The Stochastic Hopf Engine provides a minimal yet interpretable framework that successfully links local feedback mechanisms and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution patterns, capturing key phenomena including quiescent-to-starburst transitions, spiral morphologies, and quenching mechanisms through stochastic bifurcation dynamics.

Abstract: We present a computational framework for galactic evolution based on a coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator, implemented with the \textbf{Stochastic Hopf Engine}. Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \textbf{Euler--Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold.
  Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \textbf{Fokker--Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure.
  Including differential shear $Ω(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} < 0$) yields ``Red and Dead'' cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.

*James Binney*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Galaxy models using analytic distribution functions of action integrals can have unphysical velocity distributions unless specific conditions are met as J_φ→0; methods are presented for constructing DFs for isotropic/radially-biased spherical systems and flattened anisotropic systems, revealing that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that galaxy models constructed from analytic distribution functions of action integrals can produce unphysical velocity distributions unless certain conditions are satisfied, particularly as J_φ approaches zero, and to develop methods for constructing physically realistic distribution functions for various galactic components.

Method: Develop distribution functions (DFs) that are analytic functions of action integrals J, with specific attention to conditions required as J_φ→0. Methods are presented for constructing DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems with specified f(J), and for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. The approach involves self-consistent model construction rather than populations confined by external potentials.

Result: The analysis reveals that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations when constructed as self-consistent models. The research also identifies that chaos likely plays a key role in maintaining constraints during adiabatic disc growth.

Conclusion: Galaxy models using analytic distribution functions of action integrals require careful construction to avoid unphysical velocity distributions, with specific conditions needed as J_φ→0. Radially-biased spherical systems constructed self-consistently are fundamentally unstable to quadrupolar perturbations, and chaos appears essential for maintaining constraints during disc growth processes.

Abstract: Galaxy models comprising several components (including dark matter) that are bound by the self-consistently generated gravitational field are readily constructed from distribution functions (DFs) that are analytic functions of the action integrals J. We explain why such models have unphysical velocity distributions unless the DFs of hot components satisfy certain conditions as J_φ-> 0. We show how DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems can be constructed with specified f(J). We show how to construct DFs for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations. Chaos is likely key to maintenance of these constraints during adiabatic disc growth.

TL;DR: JWST spectroscopy reveals that photometrically selected extreme emission-line galaxies (EW >5000Å) contain both AGN and young star-forming sources, with ~10-35% hosting broad-line AGN, but AGN do not dominate the extreme emission even when present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what types of sources (AGN vs. young star formation) produce extreme ionizing radiation in the early Universe, and to test the performance of photometric selections for identifying extreme emission-line galaxies.

Method: Combined JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from multiple surveys (CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS, CEERS) to study photometrically identified EELGs with EW >5000Å in Hα or Hβ+[OIII]. Used deep G395M THRILS survey (~8 hr) to identify broad-line AGN, analyzed color-color selection for AGN removal, and compared emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies.

Result: Identified 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7; photometric color-color selection effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines; ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines (35% in deep spectroscopy); AGN selected as EELGs often have incorrectly high photometric EWs; narrow Hα dominates over broad component in highest-EW sources with AGN.

Conclusion: While a significant fraction of photometrically selected extreme emission-line galaxies host AGN, the AGN do not dominate the extreme emission, suggesting that even when AGN are present, other processes (likely young star formation) are responsible for the extreme line emission in the highest-EW sources.

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic study of photometrically identified extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) >5000 A of either H alpha or H beta + [OIII] in the CEERS legacy deep field utilizing JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS and CEERS surveys. This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.

*Shing-Chi Leung,Henry Yerdon,Seth Walther,Ken'ichi Nomoto,Aurora Simionescu*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper extends supernova modeling from spherical to aspherical jet-induced explosions to better match observed elemental abundances, particularly odd-number and iron-group elements, and demonstrates collapsars' importance in Galactic Chemical Evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous spherical explosion models improved fitting but still failed to match certain observed elemental ratios (e.g., Ni/Fe). Precise measurements from Hitomi telescope on Perseus Cluster provide constraints on supernova yields, necessitating more realistic aspherical explosion models to explain observed elemental diversity.

Method: Extended calculations to aspherical explosions using jet-induced explosion mechanism. Employed large post-processing nuclear network to track production of odd-number elements (V, Mn, Cu) and iron-group elements. Explored parameter space of jet-driven explosions to match observed diversity in ⁵⁶Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Applied collapsar models in Galactic Chemical Evolution context to constrain rates and parameters using galactic stellar abundances.

Result: Jet-driven explosions create model diversity compatible with observed elemental trends. Collapsar models significantly affect certain elements (e.g., Zn) and are necessary to explain multiple elemental trends in Milky Way. Galactic stars, including Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, provide constraints on collapsar rates and parameters.

Conclusion: Collapsars are a necessary component in Galactic Chemical Evolution models to explain observed elemental abundance patterns. Aspherical jet-induced explosion models better reproduce observed elemental ratios and diversity compared to spherical models, particularly for odd-number and iron-group elements.

Abstract: The Perseus Cluster has been precisely measured by the legacy Hitomi telescope on the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). These element abundance ratios provide insight into the typical behaviour of supernovae. In Paper II, we presented new massive star explosion models at various metallicity, assuming spherical explosions. We show that while the fitting is improved, some features (e.g., Ni/Fe) remain to be improved. In this article, we extend our calculation to an aspherical explosion using the jet-induced explosion mechanism. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of odd-number elements (V, Mn, Cu) and iron-group elements. We further explore how the jet-driven explosions create the diversity of models which could be compatible with the observed diversity in terms of $^{56}$Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Finally, we apply the new collapsar models in the Galactic Chemical Evolution context. We study how the galactic stars, including the Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, can put constraints on the relative rates of collapsar and some of its model parameters. We show that collapsar could lead to significant changes in some elements, e.g., Zn. Our study shows that the collapsar is a necessary component to explain multiple elemental trends observed in the Milky Way Galaxy.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Researchers developed a halo photometry method to extract light curves from TESS's unsaturated halo pixels for 98 bright stars, enabling asteroseismic analysis and variable star studies previously impossible due to saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The brightest stars observed by TESS saturate the detector, preventing detailed photometric analysis despite their importance for high-resolution studies and long observational histories. A method was needed to extract usable data from these saturated targets.

Method: Adapted K2 halo photometry technique to extract light curves from unsaturated halo pixels of stars' point spread functions in TESS data. Applied to 98 brightest stars from Sectors 1-93, using pyMON for asteroseismic analysis and combining with interferometric/radiometric angular diameters.

Result: Successfully extracted light curves for 98 bright stars including 15 red giants, 5 δ Scuti variables, 8 stochastic low-frequency variables, 8 eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. Measured ν_max for 13 red giants (5 first-time detections) and Δν for β Gem. Discovered new variability in α Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in ε Car, and new eclipsing binary γ And. Identified 18 stars for future PLATO observations and 69 with SONG data.

Conclusion: Halo photometry enables asteroseismic and variable star studies of bright, saturated TESS targets, expanding the mission's scientific yield. The method provides valuable data for future missions like PLATO and complements existing ground-based networks like SONG.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $δ$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $ν_{\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $Δν$ for one of them, $β$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $ν_{\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $δ$ Scuti and $γ$ Doradus variability in $α$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $ε$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $γ$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

### [22] [Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22516)
*Wuming Yang,Shuya Dou,Xiangcun Meng,Yaqian Wu,Shaolan Bi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Rotating stellar models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields successfully explain the Spite plateau and cosmological lithium problem, showing that stellar depletion processes rather than BBN physics are responsible for the observed lithium abundance discrepancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cosmological lithium problem - the discrepancy between observed lithium abundances in halo stars (Spite plateau at 2.0-2.4 dex) and BBN predictions (~2.72 dex) - requires explanation through either new physics or astrophysical processes.

Method: Employed stellar evolution models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to simulate lithium evolution in stars with ages 8-13 Gyr and effective temperatures 6400-5900 K.

Result: Rotating models successfully reproduce the Spite plateau (2.0-2.4 dex) and predict a sharp lithium decline below 5200 K, followed by another plateau at ~1.0 dex for red giants. Models match BBN initial abundance of 2.72 dex and also reproduce lithium and beryllium distributions in stars showing Spite plateau meltdown.

Conclusion: The cosmological lithium problem arises from stellar lithium depletion processes rather than issues with BBN physics. Rotating stellar models with realistic physical processes can fully explain observed lithium abundance patterns in Galactic halo stars.

Abstract: The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0--2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy -- referred to as the cosmological Li problem -- is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8--13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0--2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Li-rich giants are important tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, requiring a statistically large and homogeneous sample for comprehensive studies.

Method: Systematic search using LAMOST low-resolution (R~1800) spectra, determining lithium abundances via template matching of Li I 6708 Å line with synthetic spectra from ATLAS9 model atmospheres, validated against high-resolution studies, with threshold A(Li)>1.65 dex and visual inspection.

Result: Over 20,000 Li-rich giants identified, corresponding to ~2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9, with abundances validated showing mean absolute error of ~0.15 dex compared to high-resolution studies.

Conclusion: Creation of a large, homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants from LAMOST low-resolution survey, providing a valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.

Abstract: Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 Å absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\rm{Li}) > 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages. This work presents a large and homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants derived from the LAMOST low-resolution survey, which provides a reliable and valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.

### [24] [A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614)
*Murchana Khusroo,Yimnasangla*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of magnetosonic solitons during geomagnetic storms from Solar Cycles 24-25 reveals they predominantly occur in early storm intervals, potentially serving as precursor signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While solitons are abundant in various space plasma environments, their observation during geomagnetic storms remains limited despite the importance of understanding storm-time plasma dynamics and potential precursor signatures.

Method: Used high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from Cluster II mission, systematically examined plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation, and developed a comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework incorporating state-of-the-art analytical techniques for reliable detection and characterization.

Result: Solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during early storm intervals prior to the main phase, suggesting they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.

Conclusion: Magnetosonic solitons observed during geomagnetic storms show consistent timing patterns that could provide valuable early indicators of storm development, offering new insights into storm-time plasma dynamics and potential forecasting applications.

Abstract: Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: JWST observations reveal significant silicate emission variability in two protoplanetary discs over 20 years, indicating structural changes in inner disc regions and outward transport of crystalline grains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate temporal variability in silicate emission from planet-forming discs using JWST's superior spectral resolution compared to previous Spitzer observations, and to understand disc structural evolution and grain transport mechanisms.

Method: Comparative analysis of JWST and Spitzer Space Telescope observations of silicate emission from discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau, spanning 20 years, focusing on spectral shape changes and temperature differences between crystalline and amorphous silicates.

Result: Significant spectral variability: Sz 96 dimmed at ≤18μm (10-15% flux variation), IP Tau brightened across all wavelengths (30-35% variation) with strong 10μm enhancement. Crystalline silicates show lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in JWST data, indicating outward transport from inner disc regions.

Conclusion: Large silicate emission variability over 20 years suggests structural changes in inner disc regions. Crystalline grains formed through high-temperature annealing in inner regions are transported outward to cooler disc areas, with JWST's superior resolution providing clearer evidence of this transport mechanism.

Abstract: Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18~$\mathrm{μm}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\mathrm{μm}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.

TL;DR: Automated TRGB identification in globular clusters using Gaia data, LOF outlier removal, polynomial RGB fitting, expanding samples to 91 clusters with metallicity-luminosity trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated, efficient method for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, addressing the need for systematic analysis of larger datasets and reducing manual intervention in astronomical data processing.

Method: Combined astronomical data from 160 globular clusters with algorithmic processing using Python scripts. Matched stellar sources with Gaia data, generated color-magnitude diagrams, applied local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers, fitted red giant branch with second-degree polynomial, and identified TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint.

Result: Expanded TRGB samples in globular clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Found decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than -1, consistent with previous studies. Derived M_I of TRGB as approximately -4.02 at extremely low metallicity, with robust trend fitting.

Conclusion: The automated approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency and provides valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis, demonstrating reliable performance in extracting astrophysical parameters from large datasets.

Abstract: This study introduces an automated approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, combining astronomical data with algorithmic methods. Using a dataset of 160 globular clusters and Python scripts, we matched stellar sources with Gaia data. Our script generates color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and uses the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers. Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity. Our approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency while providing valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: RBEs are short-lived chromospheric absorption features (20-60s lifetimes) with high upward velocities (20-140 km/s) that transport significant plasma mass from chromosphere to corona, serving as dynamic mass conduits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamic properties of Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) as on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules, understanding their role in chromosphere-corona mass transfer.

Method: High-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection (blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria) and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms (spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods).

Result: RBEs have lifetimes of 20-60s (mean ~75s) with exponential decay distribution; velocities of 20-140 km/s (mean ~26 km/s); lengths of 1.2-5.5 Mm; repeated activity at magnetic footpoints; significant upward mass flux.

Conclusion: RBEs are dynamic conduits of mass transfer from chromosphere to corona, playing a key role in chromosphere-corona coupling through impulsive plasma transport.

Abstract: Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) are transient blue-shifted chromospheric absorption features widely interpreted as the on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules. We investigate their dynamic properties using high-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms. RBEs were identified through blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria and tracked using spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods to determine lifetimes and kinematic evolution. The statistical analysis shows that RBEs are short-lived events with lifetimes predominantly between 20 to 60 s and a mean duration of approximately 75 s. The lifetime distribution follows an exponential decay profile, indicative of impulsive driving. Line-of-sight velocities range from 20 to 140 km s-1, with a mean near 26 km s-1. Projected lengths span 1.2-5.5 Mm with sub-arcsecond widths, and recurrence analysis reveals repeated activity at localized magnetic footpoints. Mass flux estimates suggest that RBEs transport significant plasma upward, contributing to chromospheric mass supply toward the corona. These findings reinforce the role of RBEs as dynamic conduits of mass transfer and key elements in chromosphere-corona coupling.

*N. Phan-Bao,M. S. Bessell,E. L. Martín*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Discovery of 23 very low-mass objects with circumstellar disks in nearby young associations, including 10 new objects, using infrared excess detection and spectroscopic confirmation of youth via lithium and accretion signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand formation processes of late-M dwarfs and brown dwarfs, study rocky planet formation around these very low-mass objects, and improve knowledge of young associations by detecting new members.

Method: Analyzed 3928 candidates using photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE with Gaia parallaxes to construct spectral energy distributions and detect infrared excess indicating disks. Followed with spectroscopic observations to confirm youth via lithium detection and measure accretion via Hα emission.

Result: Detected 23 objects with circumstellar disks: 10 new discoveries and 13 previously known. 21 are brown dwarf candidates, 2 are very low-mass stars. Found DENIS J0534552-104808 as potential first brown dwarf candidate in foreground population of Orion D cloud. Confirmed lithium in 11 candidates, identified 7 accretors and 1 potential accretor, including intense long-lived accretion in a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate.

Conclusion: Successful detection of young very low-mass objects with disks provides insights into formation mechanisms and supports potential for rocky planet formation around brown dwarfs. The intense accretion in older brown dwarfs suggests extended disk lifetimes favorable for planetesimal formation.

Abstract: It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: GJ 504's unusual magnetic activity and rotation for its age may be explained by planet engulfment, supported by magnetic field analysis and wind-driven angular momentum loss calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GJ 504's anomalous properties (short rotation period and intense magnetic activity for its evolved age) could be explained by planet engulfment, providing observational constraints to test this scenario.

Method: Used ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric observations with Zeeman-Doppler imaging to characterize GJ 504's large-scale magnetic field, then applied 3D MHD simulations to model stellar wind and angular momentum loss, comparing rotational evolutionary tracks with and without planet engulfment.

Result: Found a 5.3 G dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field; derived wind-driven angular momentum loss; only planet engulfment scenario explains observed rotation, X-ray luminosity, and angular momentum loss constraints; identified HD 75332 as another candidate.

Conclusion: Planet engulfment likely explains GJ 504's anomalous properties, suggesting this phenomenon may not be isolated and could affect other stars with similar characteristics.

Abstract: With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\rm \dot{J}$). We then compared $\rm \dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\rm \dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.

### [30] [Characterising the magnetospheric accretion process of DF Tauri's primary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23015)
*K. Pouilly,M. Audard*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The study investigates accretion in binary star system DF Tau, finding that the primary star undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, while revealing significant magnetic topology differences between the accreting primary and non-accreting secondary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While magnetospheric accretion is well-understood for isolated classical T Tauri stars, the accretion process in multiple star systems remains poorly understood. This research aims to extend the magnetospheric accretion framework to binary systems, specifically focusing on DF Tau where only the primary star is accreting material.

Method: Used time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument to study accretion-related emission line variability, veiling, and magnetic field topology of the primary star in the DF Tau binary system.

Result: The primary star of DF Tau undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field that funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. A significant difference in magnetic topology was identified between the two stars.

Conclusion: Magnetospheric accretion can successfully describe accretion in binary systems like DF Tau, but the magnetic topology differences between accreting and non-accreting components raise questions about accretion's influence on magnetic field evolution or potential capture scenarios for the secondary star.

Abstract: The accretion process in young stellar objects (YSOs) is fundamental to the formation of stellar systems. This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. We also identified a significant difference in the magnetic topology of the two stars querying the influence of accretion of the evolution of the magnetic field, or capture of the secondary star.

### [31] [Searching for low-mass stars with magnetically-induced hyper-inflated radii](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23147)
*D. J. Mullan,J. MacDonald*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of Kepler eclipsing binaries suggests some low-mass stars may be "hyper-inflated" to roughly double their predicted radii due to strong internal magnetic fields, with field strengths potentially reaching 100-300 kG in stars below 0.4 solar masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for empirical evidence of "hyper-inflated" stars - those with radii inflated to roughly double theoretical predictions - in existing data, particularly focusing on magnetically active low-mass stars where such inflation is theoretically predicted.

Method: Analyzed data from Cruz et al.'s photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries (88 stars) in the Kepler field, using a magneto-convective model to interpret observed radius inflations in terms of internal magnetic field strengths.

Result: The data hints at hyper-inflation in some stars. Model shows average empirical inflations can be replicated with internal magnetic fields of ~10 kG for stars >0.6 solar masses, but stars <0.4 solar masses may require much stronger fields (100-300 kG) to approach hyper-inflated status.

Conclusion: Some low-mass stars in Kepler binaries may be hyper-inflated due to strong internal magnetic fields. High-resolution spectroscopy of these binaries is needed to confirm or refute these conclusions about magnetic field-induced radius inflation.

Abstract: Precise empirical estimates of stellar radii have revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions: the largest inflations occur in magnetically active stars. Theoretically, the radii of magnetically active stars are in some cases found to be 'hyper-inflated' to roughly double the radius of a non-magnetic star with equal mass. Here we ask, do data exist which could allow us to search for empirical evidence in support of hyper-inflated stars? A photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may help us in our search. The Cruz et al. study, although subject to large uncertainties, hints at the presence of hyper-inflation in some of the 88 stars in their sample. Their data enable us to set theoretical limits on the maximum strength Bc of magnetic fields inside their sample stars. According to our magneto-convective model, the average empirical inflations found from analysis of the Cruz et al. data can be replicated if Bc approx. 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than ~ 0.6 MSun. On the other hand, in stars with masses less than about 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the average empirical inflations of the stars may approach hyper-inflated status. Such stars may require significantly stronger internal fields, i.e. Bc approx. 100-300 kG. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Kepler binaries could help to confirm or refute our conclusions.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Solar Orbiter observations reveal sulfur fractionation in coronal plumes, providing evidence for wave-driven fractionation processes consistent with the ponderomotive force model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies of elemental fractionation in coronal plumes using low-FIP elements produced conflicting results. Intermediate-FIP elements like sulfur may provide additional diagnostic insight into fractionation processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species, potentially revealing wave-driven mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March-April 2024 using SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment) to derive sulfur-to-nitrogen ratios. Used EUV imaging and magnetograms for context. Processed data with SAFFRON (Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise) Python tool.

Result: Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, contrasting with surrounding interplume plasma.

Conclusion: Results provide first evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, that wave dynamics in the chromosphere drive the fractionation process.

Abstract: Coronal plumes are bright, narrow structures rooted in coronal holes that contribute to the solar wind. Their composition, particularly elemental fractionation as a function of first ionization potential (FIP), provides diagnostics of plasma properties and magnetic connectivity. Earlier plume studies of fractionation using low-FIP elements reached conflicting conclusions. Intermediate-FIP elements may provide additional diagnostic insight, since their fractionation is thought to involve processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species. We investigate sulfur (intermediate-FIP element) in plumes to assess the presence of fractionation, its evolution, and its relation to wave activity. We analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March--April 2024, using Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) to derive the sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. EUV imaging and magnetograms provided additional context. Data were processed with the open-source Python tool Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise (SAFFRON). Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, in contrast with the surrounding interplume plasma. These results provide the evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, wave dynamics in the chromosphere as a driver.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study investigates tidal synchronization in Pleiades binaries using Gaia DR3, K2 rotation periods, and spectroscopic orbits, finding synchronization transition near 8.6-14 days comparable to circularization period, with synchronization strongly dependent on mass ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tidal interactions in close binaries are crucial for long-term rotational and orbital evolution, but direct observational constraints on synchronization in open clusters remain limited. The Pleiades cluster provides an ideal coeval population to study tidal synchronization and compare it with known circularization periods.

Method: Combined Gaia DR3 cluster membership, K2 mission rotation periods, and long-term spectroscopic survey orbital solutions for binaries. Compared pseudo-synchronization period to rotation period of primary stars to assess tidal synchronization. Analyzed 42 binaries with reliable orbital and rotation periods.

Result: Identified seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb < 8.6 days (one early-type, six late-type). Binaries with longer Porb generally show super-synchronized primaries and eccentric orbits. Found synchronization transition near Porb ~ 8.6-14 days, comparable to known circularization period (~7.2 days). Synchronization depends more strongly on mass ratio than primary mass. Most synchronized systems have high mass ratios and may evolve into double white dwarfs.

Conclusion: Similar critical period scales exist for synchronization and circularization in Pleiades binaries. Tides strongly brake rotation in close early-type binaries but have weaker influence on late-type binaries, whose spins largely follow single-star sequence. High mass ratio systems are most likely to achieve synchronization.

Abstract: Tidal interactions in close binaries play a key role in the long-term rotational and orbital evolution. The distributions of circularization across open clusters (OCs) place strong observational constraints on tidal dissipation in binaries. However, direct observational constraints on synchronization among binaries in OCs remain limited. For the 125 Myr OC Pleiades, this work combines cluster membership from Gaia Data Release 3, rotation periods from the K2 mission, and orbital solutions of the binary population from a long-term spectroscopic survey, to investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the pseudo-synchronization period to the rotation period of the primary stars. Among 42 binaries with reliable orbital periods Porb and rotation periods, we identify seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb < 8.6 days, including one early-type system and six late-type systems. For binaries with longer Porb, primaries generally are super-synchronized, and most systems are eccentric. We find a synchronization transition near Porb ~ 8.6-14 days, comparable to the known circularization period (Porb ~ 7.2 days) in the Pleiades, which suggests similar critical period scales for synchronization and circularization in this coeval population. Synchronization depends much more strongly on mass ratio than on primary mass. Most synchronized systems in Pleiades have high mass ratios and are likely to evolve into double white dwarf systems. Tides likely impose strong rotational braking on close early-type binaries, while their influence on late-type close binaries is weaker, and their spins largely follow the single-star sequence.

### [34] [Dyson spheres on H-R diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23270)
*Amirnezam Amiri*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Dyson spheres around white dwarfs and M-dwarfs produce distinct infrared signatures: white dwarf spheres are cooler/fainter in near-mid IR, while M-dwarf spheres are brighter but at longer wavelengths, with both having equilibrium temperature scaling as R_D^-1/2.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Dyson spheres as potential techno-signatures around specific stellar types (white dwarfs and M-dwarfs) by analyzing their equilibrium temperatures, luminosities, and observational signatures to guide future techno-signature searches.

Method: Used radiative balance arguments with representative stellar parameters to compute temperature-radius relationships for full energy interception, placed hypothetical Dyson spheres on Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and analyzed their blackbody emissions.

Result: Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler, fainter emissions peaking in near-to-mid infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths; equilibrium temperature scales as R_D^-1/2 for both, with total luminosity and bolometric flux fixed by stellar output.

Conclusion: Low-luminosity stars (white dwarfs and M-dwarfs) are astrophysically suitable hosts for Dyson spheres, and their distinct infrared signatures provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.

Abstract: The construction of Dyson spheres, megastructures designed to capture the total radiative output of stars, can be one of the most compelling techno-signature scenarios for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. By considering equilibrium temperatures, we investigate the luminosities and fluxes of Dyson spheres built around two promising classes of host stars: white dwarfs and red M-dwarfs. Using radiative balance arguments and representative stellar parameters, we compute the temperature-radius relationship for full energy interception and place these hypothetical structures on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram to assess their observational signatures. Our results show that Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler and fainter blackbody emissions, peaking in the near- to mid-infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths. In both cases, the equilibrium temperature decreases as R_ D^-1/2, while the total luminosity and observed bolometric flux remain fixed by the stellar output. These findings highlight the astrophysical suitability of low-luminosity stars as Dyson sphere hosts and provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The precise chemical abundance measurements from the Hitomi telescope in the Perseus Cluster provide an opportunity to constrain CCSN nucleosynthesis yields and understand the relative contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae to cosmic chemical enrichment.

Method: Extended stellar evolutionary and CCSN models for initial masses 15-60 M⊙ and metallicities Z=0-Z⊙, with detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles calculated using large post-processing networks. Parameter surveys of supernova yields to find best-fit configurations matching Perseus Cluster abundances.

Result: The study identifies optimal CCSN yield configurations that best reproduce the Perseus Cluster abundance pattern, providing constraints on how individual chemical elements affect the relative contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae.

Conclusion: The analysis of CCSN yields across mass and metallicity ranges, constrained by Perseus Cluster data, provides insights into the nucleosynthetic contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae to cosmic chemical enrichment, with implications for galactic chemical evolution models.

Abstract: The legacy Hitomi telescope has delivered the precise measurements of the chemical abundances in the Perseus Cluster, covering the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). In Paper I (Leung et al., ApJ 2025), we examined the role of convection parameters and presented new core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion models at solar metallicity, which fit the observed abundance pattern. In this article, we extend our calculation for the stellar evolutionary models and CCSN models of the initial mass $15 - 60M_{\odot}$ and the metallicity $Z = 0 - Z_{\odot}$. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of $α$-chain elements (e.g., Si, S, Ar), odd-number elements (e.g., P, K, Cl), and iron-group elements (e.g., Mn, Ni). We study the role of CCSNe in the production of these elements. We compare the galactic chemical evolution model based on the nucleosynthesis yield of the new massive stars and other yield tables from the literature. For each supernova yield, we perform parameter surveys and search for configurations that produce the best-fit model and best-rate model using the Perseus Cluster as the reference. From the survey, we study how individual chemical elements affect the contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae in the cosmic chemical enrichment
