### [1] [Energy and mass transport associated with impulsive spicular flows in solar coronal holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19953)
*Lei Ni,Jun Lin,Tanmoy Samanta,Guanchong Cheng,Yifu Wang,Robert Erdelyi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the long-standing coronal heating problem by showing how solar spicules, driven by convective motions and magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere, transport mass and energy to sustain the corona and solar wind in coronal holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the 80-year-old puzzle of how the solar atmosphere heats from ~5,000-6,000 K in the lower atmosphere to ~1-2 MK in the corona, and to understand the same heating mechanism for stellar coronae.

Method: Combined MHD simulations with observations in coronal hole environments (characterized by locally open magnetic field lines) to study solar spicules and their impact on the corona.

Result: Convective/turbulent motions cause shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection, driving spicule formation (~300s quasi-period, 200-500km width). Spicule upflows provide mass flux >10⁻⁹ kg·m⁻²·s⁻¹ to sustain solar wind and trigger slow-mode waves/shocks that supply 10-100 W·m⁻² energy flux, dissipated to maintain ~1 MK corona. Upward PDs in EUV are caused by both spicule flows and waves.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive mechanism for coronal heating and solar wind origin in coronal holes, linking lower atmospheric dynamics (convection, reconnection) to spicule formation and subsequent wave generation/dissipation that sustains the hot corona.

Abstract: How the solar atmosphere is heated from a temperature of about $5,000-6,000$\,K in the lower atmosphere to about $1-2$\,MK in the corona has challenged the astrophysical community for about 80 years. The same puzzle exists for the stellar coronae heating as well. In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere. The combined effects of shock compression and reconnection outflows then drive the formation of groups of spicules with a quasi-period of about $300$\,s and width of $\sim 200-500$\,km. The spicule upflows provide an averaged mass flux above $10^{-9}$\,kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to sustain the solar wind in coronal holes, and they continuously trigger further new local slow-mode waves and shocks. These waves supply an energy flux of $10-100$\,W\,m$^{-2}$ in the lower corona, and they are dissipated by heat conduction and compression heating to sustain the corona temperature of about $1$\,MK. The results also indicate that the upward propagating disturbances (PDs) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands are caused by both spicule upflows and slow-mode waves and shocks. Our findings help to understand the long standing problem of coronal heating and the origin of solar winds in coronal hole regions.

### [2] [21,864 Unresolved, Low-mass Binaries Identified via their Overluminosity in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and a Catalog of 347,440 Systems within 100 pc of the Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20096)
*Zachary Way,Sébastien Lépine,Jonathan Gagné,Ilija Medan*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A method using Gaia DR3 XP spectra to identify unresolved equal-mass binaries among K and M dwarfs within 100pc, finding ~13% are overluminous binaries, and creating a comprehensive multiplicity catalog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-mass star fundamental parameters from photometry/astrometry are complicated by 10-20% predicted equal-mass binaries that appear more luminous than single stars, requiring methods to differentiate them.

Method: Train Random Forest Regression models on Gaia DR3 XP spectra to predict absolute magnitude and color, iteratively removing overluminous stars to converge on single-star model, then identify overluminous binaries in 100pc sample.

Result: ~13% of K and M dwarfs within 100pc are significantly overluminous and identified as unresolved binaries; a comprehensive Catalog of Systems is created with lower limits on multiplicity fraction for 0.1-0.7 M⊙ stars.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies unresolved equal-mass binaries using Gaia spectra, providing a systematic approach to multiplicity studies and enabling more accurate fundamental parameter determination for low-mass stars.

Abstract: The fundamental parameters of a low-mass star can potentially be determined from its photometry and astrometry. This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\sim13\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc. We use this \textit{Catalog} to provide lower limits on the multiplicity fraction for stars between $0.1$ and $0.7~M_{\odot}$.

### [4] [MIGHTEE: Discovery of a triple-double radio galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19729)
*Tombo F. Rarivoarinoro,Zara Randriamanakoto,Russ Taylor,Marisa Brienza,Fabio Luchsinger,Sushant Dutta,Catherine Hale,Jacinta Delhaize,Ndivhuwo Netshiavha,Solohery Randriamampandry,Mattia Vaccari*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Discovery of J022248-060934, a new triple-double radio galaxy at z≈0.94 with three pairs of radio lobes indicating recurrent nuclear activity, analyzed using MIGHTEE data revealing spectral aging and rapid duty cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triple-double radio galaxies (TDRGs) are rare objects that can constrain radio galaxy duty cycles. The discovery of a new TDRG at high redshift provides an opportunity to study recurrent nuclear activity and environmental effects.

Method: Used MIGHTEE-DR1 dataset and sub-band images for total intensity and polarimetry analysis. Performed spectral index and curvature mapping, and applied JP model for individual spectral age fitting of source components.

Result: Identified a bright core with triple-double, edge-brightened radio emission. Polarimetry revealed inhomogeneous environment density consistent with eastern lobe bending. Spectral analysis showed inverted core and ultra-steepening toward outer lobes. Spectral age fitting gave lower limit total age of ~16 Myr, short inactive periods between active phases, and rapid duty cycle of 90% for first activity cycle.

Conclusion: Triple-double structures in TDRGs are not products of long quiescent periods as previously thought based on kinematic ages, but rather result from rapid duty cycles with short inactive periods between active phases.

Abstract: Triple-double radio galaxies (TDRGs) are amongst the rarest subpopulations of radio galaxies (RGs). They are characterised by three pairs of radio lobes, where each pair of lobes represents an episode of nuclear activity. Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages.

### [5] [The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19746)
*Yuting Li,Qingshun Hu,Yufei Cai,Yu Dai,Mingfeng Qin,Yangping Luo*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper investigates morphological stability of 1,490 open clusters using a new parameter Ncore/Nouter (ratio of member numbers between core and outer areas), finding it's more sensitive than geometric parameters for tracing stability, with spatial and age-dependent variations revealing different tidal force impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open clusters evolve as member numbers change, affecting their morphology. The study aims to investigate morphological stability of open clusters and explore how stability varies with spatial position in the Galaxy, using a new parameter to better trace these changes.

Method: Analyzed 1,490 open clusters from literature catalog. Defined new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter (ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii). Compared this against geometric parameter Score/Souter. Examined correlations with total member count N, analyzed spatial variations (radial vs. tangential directions), and age dependencies.

Result: Ncore/Nouter shows significant positive correlation with N (slope 1.140±0.039), steeper than Score/Souter (0.720±0.026), indicating stellar density in core is more sensitive tracer for morphological stability. Radial sample clusters have larger slopes (1.083±0.116 for Ncore/Nouter, 0.733±0.080 for Score/Souter) than tangential (1.013±0.110 and 0.529±0.075), suggesting stronger impact from tidal forces toward Galactic center. Young clusters (<30 Myr) show shallow slope (0.751±0.166) while old clusters (>800 Myr) show steep slope (1.442±0.128), indicating young clusters endure both internal disruptions and external disturbances.

Conclusion: The new parameter Ncore/Nouter is a more sensitive indicator of open cluster morphological stability than geometric parameters. Spatial variations reveal differential impact of Galactic tidal forces, with radial forces toward Galactic center having stronger effect than shear forces from differential rotation. Age-dependent stability patterns suggest young clusters experience more disruption from both internal and external sources compared to older clusters.

Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\pm0.116 and 0.733\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\pm0.110 and 0.529\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751\pm0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442\pm0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.

### [6] [Probing the Milky Way Halo with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data Release 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19858)
*T. Muraveva,L. Monti,D. Massari,M. De Leo,A. Garofalo,G. Clementini,E. Ceccarelli,U. Michelucci*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: RR Lyrae stars used to identify Milky Way halo substructures via orbital analysis and clustering, revealing metallicity distributions of accreted systems and distinguishing in-situ vs accreted origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Milky Way stellar halo contains debris from past accretion events, serving as a fossil record of hierarchical assembly. RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers for identifying and characterizing these substructures due to their distinct properties.

Method: Analyzed 4933 RR Lyrae stars, calculated integrals of motion and orbital parameters, applied CLiMB clustering framework for substructure identification, analyzed metallicity distributions, and used RRL-based mass-metallicity relation to test substructure origins.

Result: Determined weighted mean metallicities for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (-1.57±0.25 dex), Sequoia (-1.64±0.26 dex), and Helmi streams (-1.66±0.19 dex). Found Thamnos has bimodal metallicity distribution with metal-poor peak at -1.94±0.20 dex. Identified ED-1 and L-RL3 as contaminated by thick disc stars. Discovered RRL over-densities corresponding to Shiva and Shakti substructures, suggesting in-situ origin.

Conclusion: RR Lyrae stars effectively trace Milky Way halo substructures, revealing distinct metallicity signatures of accreted systems and enabling discrimination between in-situ and accreted origins. The analysis provides insights into the chemical evolutionary status of accreted systems during early epochs and validates the use of RRL-based mass-metallicity relations for substructure characterization.

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo, containing debris from past accretion events, serves as a fossil record of hierarchical mass assembly. Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures.

### [7] [Bar Formation During a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like Merger Event](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19995)
*Bin-Hui Chen,Juntai Shen,Paola Di Matteo*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Merger mass ratio is the primary factor determining bar survival, with higher ratios destroying bars and intermediate ratios creating weakening bars, while impact parameter and orbital inclination have secondary effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how galaxy mergers affect bar formation and survival, as bars can form internally or be triggered by interactions, but the impact of mergers on bars has not been thoroughly studied.

Method: Constructed N-body merger simulations where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like satellite galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation, varying merger parameters: mass ratio (m/M), impact parameter (b), and orbital inclination angle (θ_i).

Result: Bar survival probability decreases with increasing mass ratio: mergers with m/M ≲ 1/10 preserve bars, m/M ≥ 1/2 destroy bars producing early-type remnants, and intermediate ratios (1/5 ≤ m/M ≤ 1/3) create weakening bars that gradually decay. Impact parameter and orbital inclination have only secondary, stochastic effects.

Conclusion: Mass ratio is the dominant factor in bar survival during mergers, with tidal forces from satellites weakening bars when crossing perpendicular to the bar's major axis, explaining the parameter dependencies.

Abstract: Bars are among the most prominent galactic structures, yet their formation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \leq m/M \leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis.

### [8] [Simulation of proton radiolysis of H2O and O2 ices with the Nautilus code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19996)
*Tian-Yu Tu,Valentine Wakelam,Jean-Christophe Loison,Marin Chabot,Emmanuel Dartois,Yang Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper investigates cosmic ray radiolysis effects on molecular cloud chemistry, implementing radiolysis processes in the Nautilus astrochemical code to model H2O ice chemistry and comparing results with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosmic ray radiolysis plays a crucial role in molecular cloud chemistry by dissociating molecules on dust grains, producing reactive species that facilitate formation of larger molecules. However, current astrochemical models need improvement to accurately simulate radiolysis processes and match experimental observations.

Method: Implemented radiolysis processes and relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. Investigated sensitivity of H2O ice simulation results by adjusting parameters including: removal of reaction-diffusion competition, removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and desorption energies of suprathermal species. Compared model outputs with experimental steady-state abundance ratios from H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments.

Result: The model with adjusted chemistry can reproduce steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios at any CR flux in experiments. However, it fails to reproduce the fluence required to reach steady state and overestimates H2O destruction in H2O radiolysis experiments. Reducing G-values of H2O radiolysis (increasing local water reformation efficiency) improves H2O destruction rate agreement. Reaction-diffusion competition significantly affects results at ζ ≲ 10⁻¹⁴ s⁻¹. Non-diffusive chemistry affects results at 16K but not 77K, while results are sensitive to desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77K.

Conclusion: While steady-state abundance ratios can be reproduced by fine-tuning chemical models, the study highlights the need for better constraints on intermediate pathways in radiolysis processes, particularly ion chemistry in ice bulk, as well as activation barriers and branching ratios of reactions in the network. Current models still have limitations in reproducing experimental fluence requirements and accurate H2O destruction rates.

Abstract: The radiolysis effect of cosmic rays (CRs) plays an important role in the chemistry in molecular clouds. CRs can dissociate the molecules on dust grains, producing reactive suprathermal species and radicals which facilitate the formation of large molecules. We add the radiolysis process and some relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $ζ\lesssim 10^{-14}\ \rm s^{-1}$. The non-diffusive chemistry affects the simulation results at 16 K but not 77K, while the results are sensitive to the desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77 K. Our results show that the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 in experiments can be reproduced by fine-tuning the chemical model, but still call for more constraints on the intermediate pathways in the radiolysis processes, especially the ion chemistry in the ice bulk, as well as activation barriers and branching ratios of the reactions in the network.
