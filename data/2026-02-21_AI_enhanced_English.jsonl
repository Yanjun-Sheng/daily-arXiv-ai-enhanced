Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lithium serves as a key astrophysical diagnostic; stellar models with transport processes can explain Li depletion patterns across Galactic populations, novae likely dominate Galactic Li production, and radial migration is crucial for understanding Milky Way Li evolution.", "motivation": "Lithium's unique diagnostic power for low-mass stellar physics, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology motivates comprehensive review of observational data, theoretical models, and evolutionary understanding of Li abundance patterns across stellar populations and Galactic history.", "method": "Review approach synthesizing Li observations across stellar evolutionary phases, evaluating strengths/limitations of theoretical stellar models, analyzing Li sources, and examining Li evolution throughout Galactic history with focus on transport processes and migration effects.", "result": "Three key findings: 1) Stellar evolution models incorporating chemical/angular momentum transport can explain Li depletion patterns (dip and plateau) across all Galactic populations; 2) Novae are likely the dominant Galactic Li source based on observational evidence; 3) Radial migration in the Galactic disk is essential for understanding Milky Way Li evolution.", "conclusion": "Lithium remains a powerful astrophysical diagnostic; comprehensive understanding requires integration of transport processes in stellar models, recognition of novae as primary Li producers, and consideration of radial migration effects to explain observed abundance patterns throughout Galactic history."}}

We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations.
