Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster.

However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy.

Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $\u03a9_{\\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rotation reduces acoustic mode amplitudes and increases damping rates in solar-like stars, explaining why rapidly rotating stars show fewer detectable oscillations in Kepler observations.", "motivation": "To test the theoretical prediction by Bessila et al.

Giant molecular clouds of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387: similarities with spiral galaxy clouds", "comment": "26 pages, 17 figures, accepted by MNRAS", "summary": "Molecular gas is crucial to understanding star formation and galaxy evolution, but the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) have rarely been studied. Here, we present analyses of the spatially resolved GMCs of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387, exploiting high spatial resolution (0.15\" or 14 pc) 12CO(2-1) line observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We identify 1285 individual GMCs and measure the fundamental properties (radius, velocity dispersion, and molecular gas mass) of each with a modified version of the CPROPStoo package. Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not. These results show that ETGs have more diversified GMC properties than previously thought. We discuss potential reasons for such diversity, and viewing-angle dependency is a plausible candidate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Analysis of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in lenticular galaxy NGC 1387 reveals they follow Milky Way-like scaling relations, are mostly virialized, and show diverse angular momentum alignment patterns, challenging previous assumptions about ETG molecular clouds.", "motivation": "Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) are poorly studied despite their importance for understanding star formation and galaxy evolution.
