### [1] [Tidal triggers and the predictability of solar activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11227)
*F. Stefani,G. M. Horstmann,G. Mamatsashvili,T. Weier*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes solar activity patterns, finding that the 1.723-year quasi-biennial oscillation period matches the dominant beat between Venus, Earth, and Jupiter spring tides, suggesting planetary tidal synchronization of solar cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between planetary tidal forces and solar activity patterns, particularly the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and its connection to planetary tidal synchronization of solar cycles.

Method: Analysis of 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares to determine the dominant period of the QBO, followed by comparison with tidal periods of Venus, Earth, and Jupiter to identify beat frequencies.

Result: The QBO period is determined to be approximately 1.723 years, which matches the dominant beat between the spring tide periods of Venus, Earth, and Jupiter. Recent solar events (2024 May 10 storm and 2026 February 1 X-flare) align with tidal forcing maxima, though the 1859 Carrington event does not fit this pattern.

Conclusion: Planetary tidal forces, particularly from Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, appear to synchronize solar activity cycles including both the quasi-biennial oscillation and the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle, though not all major solar events follow this tidal pattern.

Abstract: Magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline are currently considered to be one of the main determinants of solar activity. In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing. By contrast, the Carrington event (1959 September 1) does not fit this pattern.

### [2] [Filling The Pockets: The Spherical Nature of 3D Deflagration in Thermonuclear Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11341)

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that turbulence and magnetic fields from the smoldering phase enhance mixing between burned/unburned material, solving the insufficient white dwarf expansion problem in delayed detonation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental inconsistency in 3D delayed detonation models where hydrodynamic simulations show insufficient white dwarf expansion during deflagration phase, failing to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of Type Ia supernovae.

Method: Used 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the FLASH code, incorporating preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields on scales expected from the smoldering phase, and compared with pure hydrodynamic simulations.

Result: Turbulence and magnetic fields promote entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, enabling conductive ignition of surrounding fuel and making effective burning approach spherical model levels, addressing the long-standing expansion problem.

Conclusion: The dominant mechanism is enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material rather than changes in small-scale flame physics, with efficiency maximized when turbulent length scales are smaller than unburned plume scales.

Abstract: We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.

### [3] [Dynamic modeling of coronal abundances during flares on M-dwarf stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11649)
*David H. Brooks,Jeffrey W. Reep,Andy S. H. To,Luke Fushimi Benavitz,Lucas A. Tarr*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Simulating solar flares in an M-dwarf-like corona with inverse FIP effect shows coronal rain formation is more difficult compared to solar-like FIP conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how extreme non-solar coronal compositions (specifically inverse FIP effect observed on M-dwarf stars) affect coronal condensation formation during flares, since solar atmospheric abundances vary spatio-temporally and dynamic modeling is needed for accurate radiative hydrodynamic simulations.

Method: Using hydrodynamic flare models with field-aligned simulations starting with a corona dominated by inverse FIP effect (depleted of low FIP elements, enriched with high FIP elements), similar to M-dwarf stellar conditions, and simulating flaring events to study coronal rain formation.

Result: A flaring event in an inverse FIP corona leads to solutions similar to solar cases, but coronal rain formation during flares on M-dwarfs is harder to achieve when the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.

Conclusion: The initial coronal composition significantly affects coronal condensation formation during flares, with inverse FIP conditions making rain formation more difficult compared to solar-like FIP conditions, highlighting the importance of including spatio-temporal abundance variations in flare simulations.

Abstract: Solar atmospheric elemental abundances are now known to vary both in space and time. Dynamic modeling of these changes is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy of radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Recent studies have shown that including spatio-temporal variations in coronal abundances during solar flares leads to the formation of coronal condensations (rain), which are otherwise difficult to create in impulsively heated field aligned hydrodynamic flare models. These simulations start with a solar corona dominated by the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, and evaporate photospheric material into the post-flare loops. We here explore perhaps the most extreme non-solar starting condition for the coronal composition in these simulations: an initial corona dominated by the inverse FIP (iFIP) effect, such as is observed on active M-dwarf stars. We show that a flaring event in a corona enriched with high FIP elements leads to a solution similar to the solar case. Coronal rain is harder to form by this method during flares on M-dwarfs, however, if the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.

TL;DR: 3D reconstruction of magnetic field and plasma parameters in a solar flare using combined microwave and stereoscopic X-ray observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing solar flare conditions is essential for understanding coronal energy release, requiring three-dimensional characterization of magnetic field and plasma parameters in flaring volumes.

Method: Combined microwave imaging spectroscopy (EOVSA) for magnetic field strength, electron densities, and power-law index derivation via gyrosynchrotron modeling, plus stereoscopic X-ray observations (Hinode/XRT and Solar Orbiter/STIX) from different vantage points for 3D loop reconstruction.

Result: Derived observational 3D maps of magnetic field strength, Alfvén speed, and plasma beta in the flaring volume, revealing a magnetically dominated environment with spatially resolved diagnostics.

Conclusion: The approach provides valuable constraints for models of magnetic reconnection and flare dynamics, representing progress toward realistic 3D characterization of energy release in solar eruptive events.

Abstract: Diagnosing solar flare conditions is essential for understanding coronal energy release. Using combined microwave and X-ray data, we reconstruct three-dimensional maps of the magnetic field and plasma parameters in the SOL2021-05-07 flare.
  We use imaging spectroscopy from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) to derive spatial maps of the magnetic field strength, thermal and nonthermal electron densities, and the power-law index of nonthermal electrons through gyrosynchrotron modeling. Simultaneous X-ray observations from Hinode/XRT and Solar Orbiter/STIX, obtained from different vantage points, enable a stereoscopic reconstruction of the flaring loop. By correlating the positions of microwave and thermal X-ray sources, we associate the three-dimensional coordinates with the microwave-derived plasma parameters.
  We derive observational three-dimensional maps of magnetic field strength, Alfvén speed, and plasma beta in the flaring volume, revealing a magnetically dominated environment. These spatially resolved diagnostics provide valuable constraints for models of magnetic reconnection and flare dynamics and represent a step toward a realistic three-dimensional characterization of energy release in solar eruptive events.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: CSST needs stable celestial benchmark fields for on-orbit calibration. Six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields based on observational visibility, stellar density, bright-star contamination, and dust extinction criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) requires rigorous on-orbit calibration for its decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey. Stable celestial benchmark fields are essential to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime.

Method: Established comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Used CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD to constrain eligible regions to ecliptic latitude |β| > 50° and galactic latitude |b| > 15°. Evaluated 29 candidate clusters meeting spatial constraints.

Result: Six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields that fulfill all critical criteria. These clusters are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for CSST's on-orbit calibration program.

Conclusion: The selected six globular clusters are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey and are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for the telescope's on-orbit calibration program.

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will perform a decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey that relies on rigorous on-orbit calibration. This necessitates stable celestial benchmark fields to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime. We establish comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Using the CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD, we constrain eligible regions to the ranges of ecliptic latitude $ |β| > 50^\circ$ and galactic latitude $|b| > 15^\circ$. From an initial sample of 29 candidate clusters meeting these spatial constraints, six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields, fulfilling all the critical criteria. These selected clusters are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for CSST's on-orbit calibration program, and are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey.

### [6] [Signatures of Damping Nonlinear Oscillations by KHI-induced Turbulence in Synthetic Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11884)
*Sihui Zhong,Andrew Hillier,Iñigo Arregui*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Nonlinear damping of coronal loop oscillations via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability-induced turbulence is studied through 3D MHD simulations and forward modeling, revealing time-varying frequency shifts, damping rates, and observational signatures that aid seismological inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes like Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and turbulence, but comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited.

Method: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images are used to investigate observational signatures of nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations.

Result: Simulations show time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory, excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods, and reduced displacement amplitudes. Synthetic observations preserve these features but require higher spatial resolution for higher-order modes. Hotter channels show faster decay with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts. Bayesian fitting shows robust constraints on initial amplitude and kink period but degeneracy in damping parameters.

Conclusion: Results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations, though additional observables are needed for reliable seismological inference of damping parameters.

Abstract: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and turbulence, though comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited. Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.

### [7] [Surface brightness-colour relations of Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds classical Cepheids based on Gaia magnitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11994)
*M. C. Bailleul,N. Nardetto,V. Hocdé,P. Kervella,W. Gieren,J. Storm,G. Pietrzyński,A. Gallenne,D. Graczyk,G. Bras,O. Creevey,A. Recio Blanco,P. de Laverny,P. A. Palicio,W. Kiviaho*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Derived surface brightness-color relations (SBCRs) for classical Cepheids in Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds using Gaia data, quantified metallicity effects, and established new period-radius relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish accurate SBCRs for classical Cepheids across different metallicities (Milky Way vs. Magellanic Clouds) using Gaia photometry and parallaxes, enabling precise distance measurements via the inverse Baade-Wesselink method for future Gaia studies.

Method: 1) Applied quality criteria to select best Gaia photometric data and parallaxes for Milky Way Cepheids; 2) Compiled literature period-radius relations and derived new PR relation from interferometric data; 3) Combined radii with distances (Gaia parallaxes for Milky Way, eclipsing binaries for Magellanic Clouds) to derive surface brightness and color for ~1700 Cepheids.

Result: 1) New PR relation: log(R/R⊙) = 1.133±0.019 + 0.688±0.016 log(P) from interferometric data; 2) Metallicity doesn't affect PR relations; 3) Derived three SBCRs showing metallicity dependence; 4) Established relations between SBCR slopes/zero points and metallicity: Slope = -0.0663±0.0121[Fe/H] - 0.3010±0.0030, ZP = -0.1016±0.0091[Fe/H] + 3.9988±0.0029.

Conclusion: New SBCRs provide essential tools for applying the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to Gaia-observed classical Cepheids, with quantified metallicity corrections crucial for accurate distance measurements across different galactic environments.

Abstract: Aims: We derive SBCRs for classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds using the photometric data available in the Gaia database, and we quantify the metallicity effect. Methods: We first selected the data on the basis of a number of quality criteria and chose the best photometric data and the best parallaxes available in Gaia for Milky Way classical Cepheids. Secondly, we compiled an extensive list of period-radius (PR) relations available in the literature, and we also provide a new PR relation based on interferometric data in our previous work. Thirdly, combining the radius of classical Cepheids with distance estimates (based on Gaia parallaxes for the Milky Way and on eclipsing binaries for the Magellanic Clouds), we derived the surface brightness and colour of about 1700 classical Cepheids. Results: We first derived a new PR relation based on interferometric data and distances from the literature of seven classical Cepheids: $\mathrm{\log(R/R_{\odot}) = 1.133_{\pm 0.019} + 0.688_{\pm 0.016} log(P)}$. The metallicity does not affect the PR relations. Secondly, we calculated three different SBCRs for the Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud classical Cepheids based on this new PR relation that clearly show the dependence of the metallicity on the SBCR based on Gaia magnitudes alone. Finally, we derived relations between the slopes, the zero points (ZP), and the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of these three SBCRs: $\mathrm{Slope_{SBCR}=-0.0663_{\pm 0.0121} [Fe/H] - 0.3010_{\pm 0.0030}}$ and $\mathrm{ZP_{SBCR}=-0.1016_{\pm 0.0091} [Fe/H] + 3.9988_{\pm 0.0029}}$. Conclusions: These new SBCRs, dedicated to classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, are of particular importance to apply the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to classical Cepheids observed by Gaia in a forthcoming study.

### [8] [The Outflow of the B335 Protostar II: After the Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12060)
*Klaus W. Hodapp,Adwin Boogert,Doug Johnstone,Valentin J. M. Le Gouellec,Eleni Tsiakaliari,Helen J. Fraser,Laurie L. Chu,Thomas Greene,Marcia J. Rieke*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: B335 protostar outburst study reveals shock front kinematics matching ongoing outburst timeline, showing CO/H₂/[Fe II] emission evolution and cavity extinction mapping with ice absorption features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effects of an ongoing major outburst in the B335 protostar on its jet and outflow cavity, using rare opportunity to observe outburst impacts on protostellar object dynamics.

Method: Used photometry of background stars to map visual continuum extinction and H₂O ice absorption; obtained precise proper motions of shock fronts; analyzed CO, H₂, and [Fe II] emission; studied CO-line-removed spectra for ice absorption features near protostar.

Result: Outflow cavity carved by jet; shock front 3E kinematic age corresponds to early phases of ongoing outburst; emission evolution shows strong CO in recent shocks diminishing to H₂/[Fe II] in older shocks; extreme extinction increase (A_V ≈ 200 mag) near protostar; increasing column densities of ¹³CO₂, OCN⁻, OCS ices toward protostar; CO gas emission near protostar with absorption at larger distances.

Conclusion: B335 outburst has directly impacted jet shock kinematics and chemistry, with shock evolution showing CO-to-H₂/[Fe II] transition, while cavity extinction mapping reveals extreme density gradients and complex ice chemistry near the protostar.

Abstract: The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.

TL;DR: LSBGs in Illustris TNG-100 have more satellites with higher velocity dispersion, satellite systems dominated by rotation, and counter-rotation relative to the primary disc, suggesting formation via quiet accretion rather than major mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the formation mechanisms of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) in ΛCDM cosmology by analyzing their properties and satellite systems compared to high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs).

Method: Analysis of central LSBGs and their satellite systems using the Illustris TNG-100 cosmological simulation, examining halo properties (spin, concentration), satellite spatial/kinematical distributions, and relationships between surface brightness and satellite properties.

Result: LSBGs have: 1) Different halo spin/concentration than HSBGs; 2) More satellites with larger velocity dispersion; 3) Continuous relation between satellite number and surface brightness; 4) Relation between surface brightness and satellite tangential velocity; 5) Satellite systems dominated by rotation; 6) Satellite systems in counter-rotation with primary disc.

Conclusion: LSBG formation is linked to satellite systems dominated by rotational support and counter-rotation, indicating they haven't experienced significant merger rates (associated with radial orbits in HSBGs), supporting formation via quiet accretion rather than major mergers.

Abstract: We analyse different properties of central low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) and their satellite systems using the simulation Illustris TNG-100, in order to deepen our understanding of the formation mechanism of LSBGs in a $Λ$CDM cosmology. We find differences in the spin and the concentrations of the LSBGs haloes and the host haloes of high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs), consistent with previous studies. By analysing their spatial and kinematical distribution of satellites, we find that LSBGs tend to have a larger number of satellites than HSBGs and with a larger velocity dispersion. Moreover, we obtain a continuous relation between the number of satellites and surface brightness, particularly for massive central galaxies. We also find a relation between surface brightness and the relative tangential velocity of the satellites. For a given stellar mass, the existence of LSBGs is strongly correlated with their satellite system dominated by rotation. Furthermore, the satellite system is systematically in counter-rotation with respect to the primary disc in LSBGs. We propose that this fact reflects that these galaxies have not experienced a significantly high rate of mergers, which are more likely associated with radial orbits expected in systems of galaxies with a high surface brightness.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: SN feedback in low-redshift analogs (Blueberry galaxies) may facilitate ionizing photon escape during reionization, with SN hosts showing bluer UV slopes but lower ionizing photon production efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how supernova feedback enables ionizing photon escape through galactic interstellar medium during cosmic reionization, using low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.

Method: Cross-matched 1242 Blueberry galaxies with transient discovery reports to identify 11 SNe (10 likely core-collapse), compared SN hosts to larger BB population, estimated SN occurrence rates, and analyzed UV slopes and ionizing photon production efficiency.

Result: SN-hosting BBs show elevated SFRs, burstier recent SFH, higher stellar masses; SN rate may be slightly suppressed compared to field galaxies; SN hosts have bluer UV slopes (2.1σ) but lower ionizing photon production efficiency (7.9σ).

Conclusion: SN-driven feedback may facilitate ionizing photon escape (bluer UV slopes) but also potentially quenches ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during reionization, highlighting complex role of SN feedback.

Abstract: While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$σ$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$σ$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.

### [11] [Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268)
*David Benisty,Noam Libeskind,Dmitry Makarov*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: CenA and M83 are infalling toward each other like the Milky Way-Andromeda system, with a total mass of ~6.36×10¹² M☉ estimated via Timing Argument calibrated with simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite observed heliocentric velocities not clearly indicating mutual attraction, the authors investigate whether Centaurus A and M83 form a bound binary system analogous to the Local Group's Milky Way-Andromeda pair, which would provide a valuable nearby analog for studying galaxy interactions.

Method: Used the Timing Argument (TA) calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, assuming line-of-sight velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter to estimate total mass. Also considered NGC 4945 as a potential perturber analogous to the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Result: Estimated total mass of CenA/M83 system as (6.36 ± 1.30) × 10¹² M☉, consistent with independent estimates from virial mass measurements and K-band luminosity-to-mass ratios, confirming the bound nature of the system.

Conclusion: CenA and M83 form a bound binary system analogous to the Local Group, providing a compelling nearby analog for studying galaxy interactions. The consistent bound signature and robust mass determination establish this as an important system for comparative studies.

Abstract: Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.

TL;DR: Quasar proximity zone spectra can constrain line-of-sight distances in high-redshift quasar pairs, enabling better characterization of their 3D configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-redshift quasar pairs (z≳5) are potential precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, but large uncertainties in their line-of-sight distances limit characterization of these systems.

Method: Using synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra and a simple peak finding algorithm to analyze spectral features and constrain line-of-sight distances between quasar pairs.

Result: For small sky-plane separations (10-100 pkpc), the method can distinguish between d_l.o.s. ≲1 pMpc and ≳1 pMpc with ~0.2 pMpc accuracy for d_l.o.s. ≥3 pMpc. For large separations (1 pMpc), it distinguishes between ≲4 pMpc and ≳4 pMpc with ~0.5 pMpc accuracy for d_l.o.s. ≳4 pMpc.

Conclusion: Quasar proximity zones provide a promising alternative method to constrain 3D configurations of quasar pairs, enabling better characterization of these high-redshift systems and their potential as supermassive black hole merger precursors.

Abstract: Recently discovered quasar pairs at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim$5) are likely precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, providing a promising window to high redshift quasar growth mechanisms. However, the large uncertainties on their relative distances along the line-of-sight ($d_{\rm l.o.s.}$) limits our ability to characterize quasar pairs. In this study, we explore synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra as an alternative method to constrain the line-of-sight distance of quasar pairs. We find that for small sky-plane separations ($d_{\rm sky}\approx 10-100$ pkpc), a simple peak finding algorithm can easily distinguish between scenarios of $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \lesssim1$ pMpc and $\gtrsim1$ pMpc. For cases where the true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \geq 3$ pMpc, the accuracy of $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimation is $\approx 0.2$ pMpc. Large sky-plane separations of $d_{\rm sky}=1$ pMpc have larger absolute uncertainties in $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates, but the method can still easily distinguish between scenarios where $d_{\rm l.o.s.}\lesssim4$ pMpc and $\gtrsim4$ pMpc. $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates have an uncertainty of $\approx$0.5 pMpc when true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \gtrsim4$ pMpc. Our proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential use of quasar proximity zones to constrain the 3-dimensional quasar pair configuration, providing an avenue to characterize quasar pairs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates why Centaurus A's inner regions lack bright satellite galaxies, finding that AGN feedback from the host galaxy's radio lobes likely quenched star formation in nearby dwarf satellites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centaurus A presents a cosmological puzzle: while its overall satellite population matches theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d<150 kpc) show a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies, creating a discrepancy that requires explanation.

Method: Used the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, calibrated to the Milky Way. Explored various physical scenarios including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion from the intergalactic medium.

Result: Fiducial models reproduce the overall Cen A satellite population but overpredict bright inner-halo satellites by factor of 4±1 at Mv < -15.8. The spatial coincidence of the deficiency with Cen A's massive radio lobes suggests AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function.

Conclusion: The "Curious Case of Centaurus A" provides evidence that AGN feedback within the host galaxy regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites, explaining the observed deficit of bright satellites in inner regions through quenching mechanisms.

Abstract: The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d<150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the "Curious Case of Centaurus A" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.

### [14] [ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW filament I. Enhanced power from excess microwave emission at high spatial frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11356)
*Simon Casassus,Matias Vidal,Miguel Carcamo,Laurent Verstraete,Nathalie Ysard,Emilie Habart*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA Band1 observations of rhoOphW PDR reveal a power-law spectrum for excess microwave emission with spectral index α=-0.78±0.05, showing increased radio power at small scales relative to IR emission and revealing compact radio-only structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rhoOphW PDR exhibits bright excess microwave emission (EME) potentially from spinning dust grains. Deep imaging and spectroscopy are needed to reveal detailed morphology, search for spectral fine structure, and constrain the high-frequency spectral drop of this anomalous microwave emission.

Method: ALMA Band1 mosaic observations (36-44GHz) produce deep deconvolved images of the filament. Cross-correlation in the uv-plane extracts spectra using the Band1 image as template. Simulations and cross-correlations with near-infrared ancillary data estimate flux-loss and biases.

Result: The spectrum follows a power law with spectral index α=-0.78±0.05, showing no detectable fine structure. Band1 power increases relative to IR signal at high spatial frequencies (2× more power at ~20″ than at ~100″ relative to IRAC 3.6μm). A compact EME source without IR counterpart is discovered embedded in filamentary Band1 signal.

Conclusion: The observations reveal a smooth power-law spectrum for the anomalous microwave emission in rhoOphW, with enhanced small-scale radio structure relative to IR emission, suggesting complex spatial variations in the emission mechanism and revealing radio-only compact sources within the PDR.

Abstract: The rhoOphW photo-dissociation region (PDR) is an example source of bright excess microwave emission (EME), over synchrotron, free-free, and the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) dust continuum. Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling.

*Sofia L. Splawska,Raphaël Errani,Jorge Peñarrubia,Matthew G. Walker*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Dwarf spheroidal galaxy mass estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about stellar density profiles, with systematic errors up to 10× when using standard dynamical mass estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard dynamical mass estimators for dwarf spheroidal galaxies rely on assumptions about stellar density profiles, but these assumptions may introduce significant systematic errors that affect our understanding of dark matter halos and scaling relations.

Method: Using spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium assumptions, the authors fit flexible stellar density models to Milky Way dSph observations. They propagate observational uncertainties about density profile shapes to dynamical mass uncertainties using the virial theorem, considering various density profile shapes and dark matter halo extents.

Result: The structural diversity of Milky Way dSphs implies potential systematic errors up to factors of 10 in standard dynamical mass estimators. Accounting for these uncertainties significantly alters the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.

Conclusion: Dynamical mass inference for dwarf spheroidal galaxies is critically dependent on assumptions about stellar density profiles, and ignoring this dependence leads to substantial systematic errors that can distort our understanding of dark matter halos and galaxy scaling relations.

Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.

TL;DR: Discovery of 323 superfine dusty fibrils (width ~0.01 pc) in 121 massive star-forming clumps across the Galaxy using ALMA-QUARKS survey, revealing denser structures than previously known filaments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize filamentary structures at finer scales in massive star-forming regions across different Galactic environments, building on previous studies of larger filaments in nearby clouds.

Method: Used ALMA-QUARKS survey 1.3 mm continuum emission data with ~900 AU resolution, applied FilFinder software for fibril identification, and RadFil software for width measurements and analysis of mass-length relations.

Result: Found 323 fibrils with typical width ~0.01 pc (10× narrower than Herschel filaments), following M∝L² relation but with significantly higher densities (N_H₂ = 10²³-10²⁴ cm⁻² vs. Herschel's 10²⁰-10²³ cm⁻²).

Conclusion: This large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps demonstrates the hierarchical nature of filamentary structures in star formation, emphasizing their crucial role across multiple physical scales from 0.1-pc filaments to 0.01-pc fibrils.

Abstract: We report the discovery of more than 323 superfine dusty filamentary structures (fibrils) inside 121 massive star forming clumps that are located in widely different Galactic environments (Galactocentric distances of $\sim$0.5-12.7 kpc). These fibrils are identified from the 1.3~mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\sim900$ AU for a source at $\sim$3 kpc, using the \textit{FilFinder} software. Using \textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \textit{APEX}) surveys. However, these fibrils are significantly denser ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{23}-10^{24}\ cm^{-2}}$) than the filaments found in previous \textit{Herschel} surveys ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{20}-10^{23}\ cm^{-2}}$). This work contributes a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, following the identification of large 0.1-pc wide filaments and associated internal velocity coherent fibers in nearby molecular clouds, further emphasizing the crucial role played by filamentary structures in star formation at various physical scales.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: First statistical study of MgII-emitting halos in 47 star-forming galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0 reveals extended emission out to tens of kpc, with outflow properties correlating with stellar mass, SFR, and sSFR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies of MgII halos tracing galaxy-scale outflows were limited to single-object analyses due to their faintness. This work aims to conduct the first statistical population-level study of circumgalactic outflows traced by extended MgII emission.

Method: Used deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0. Extended previous outflow modeling framework (radially accelerating shells) from single-object analysis to larger sample. Analyzed extended MgII emission out to tens of kiloparsecs.

Result: Detected extended emission out to tens of kpc. Galaxies with MgII outflows have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations. Winds accelerate linearly with radius from ~60 km/s to ~490 km/s (correlating with stellar mass). Inner regions highly opaque with tentative stellar mass-central optical depth correlation. Opening angle depends on stellar mass (wide for less massive, both wide/narrow for more massive). HLR peaks at ~5 kpc with tail to ~20 kpc. Compact halos (<8 kpc) correlate with stellar mass; extended halos do not.

Conclusion: First statistical study reveals systematic relationships between outflow properties and galaxy characteristics, suggesting star-formation-driven winds. Different correlations for compact vs extended halos may indicate different powering mechanisms.

Abstract: Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that astrochemical models developed for interstellar medium can be adapted to simulate laboratory astrophysics experiments on CO hydrogenation to methanol, showing fair agreement despite some discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between astrochemical models and laboratory experiments by testing whether interstellar medium models can be directly compared with experimental results, addressing the historical lack of direct confrontation between models and dedicated laboratory data.

Method: Conducted 9 low-temperature CO hydrogenation experiments varying temperature and dose parameters, then used three astrochemical codes (NAUTILUS, pyRate, MONACO) to simulate experimental conditions, carefully adapting vocabulary and scales for fluxes and time scales.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of using astrochemical codes to compare modeling results directly with experimental outputs, achieving fair agreement despite discrepancies between models and experiments, and between different models themselves.

Conclusion: Astrochemical models can be successfully adapted to simulate laboratory experiments, though discrepancies highlight potential issues in chemical networks or physical process descriptions that require further investigation.

Abstract: The development of molecular complexity during stellar and planetary formation owes much to the interaction of gas and dust. When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited. Since then, many groups have developed specific experimental setups to address this issue, but astrochemical models have rarely been directly confronted with these new results. We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes.

TL;DR: JWST medium-band photometry reveals shallow nebular attenuation curve and patchy dust geometry in cosmic noon galaxies, with dustiness increasing with stellar mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon (z=1.2-2.4) using JWST medium-band emission line measurements.

Method: Used JWST/MegaScience/UNCOVER medium-band photometry to measure Hα fluxes for 209 galaxies and Paβ fluxes for 66 galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4. Compared Paβ/Hα ratios with mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched MOSDEF sample with spectroscopic Hα/Hβ measurements.

Result: Paβ/Hα ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and SFR, indicating more massive galaxies are dustier. Shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve fits observations better than Cardelli et al. (1989) curve, especially for massive galaxies. No trend between nebular attenuation and axis ratio suggests localized clumpy dust. Shallower curve increases inferred A_Hα,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses.

Conclusion: Dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform in cosmic noon galaxies, especially massive ones. JWST medium bands enable statistical constraints on dust properties for large galaxy samples in upcoming programs.

Abstract: We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85<\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)<11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.

TL;DR: Study finds AGN activity in nearby post-starburst galaxies is not significantly enhanced compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies, suggesting AGN feedback at low redshift is more preventive than ejective in quenching star formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AGN feedback drives star formation quenching by examining AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies at low redshift, addressing the paradox of weak AGN in nearby quenching galaxies despite theoretical expectations.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis using eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio) data for post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z<0.2. Applied AGN incidence assessment, stacking techniques for undetected galaxies, and comparison of observed luminosity to star formation expectations (L_obs/L_SF).

Result: PSBs show radio and X-ray emission consistent with star formation dominance. While PSBs have twice the MIR AGN incidence rate of SFGs, their AGN luminosities are small compared to literature MIR AGN. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs.

Conclusion: AGN's role in quenching at low redshift appears subtle rather than violent - feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective." Obscured, low-luminosity AGN may exist in PSBs but would be fueled by residual gas from preceding starbursts and not play a dominant quenching role.

Abstract: The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective".

TL;DR: Deep HST F225W observations of Abell 2744 enable measurement of the UV luminosity function at z~0.55 down to extremely faint luminosities (M_UV < -13.5), revealing a steep faint-end slope and ruling out a turn-over brighter than M_UV = -15.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the faint end of the UV luminosity function at intermediate redshifts (0.4 < z < 0.7) by combining deep near-UV HST observations with gravitational lensing magnification, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime that is typically inaccessible.

Method: Extended Hubble Frontier Fields observations with HST WFC3/UVIS in F225W band; used gravitational lensing magnification from Abell 2744 cluster; identified 152 faint galaxies through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection; applied maximum likelihood estimation with Schechter function parameterization including curvature parameter δ to account for possible faint-end turn-over.

Result: Derived best-fit Schechter parameters for UV LF at z~0.55 down to M_UV < -13.5 mag, with faint-end slope α = -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}; ruled out a turn-over brighter than M_UV = -15.5 at 3σ confidence level using curvature parameter analysis.

Conclusion: The study successfully probes extremely faint galaxies at intermediate redshifts, finding a steep faint-end slope for the UV luminosity function and providing strong constraints against a turn-over at luminosities brighter than M_UV = -15.5, advancing our understanding of low-luminosity galaxy populations.

Abstract: By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog. Using a sample defined by a $50\%$ completeness cut and applying the maximum likelihood estimation, we derive the best-fit Schechter parameters for the UV LF at $z \sim 0.55$ down to $M_\text{UV} < -13.5$ mag, including a faint-end slope of $α= -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$. We incorporate a curvature parameter $δ$ in parameter estimation to account for a possible turn-over at the faint end of the UV LF, leveraging the exceedingly low luminosities probed by our sample. Our results rule out a turn-over brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at the $3σ$ confidence level.

Method: Analyzed JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectroscopic observations of confirmed z>9 galaxies, modeling their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission, particularly damped Lyman-α absorption features to derive HI column densities and star-formation rate surface densities.

Result: All galaxies show highly efficient star formation with rapid ~10-100 Myr depletion timescales, exceeding local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and simulation predictions. Dense HI gas drives offsets from fundamental-metallicity relation while dust-to-gas ratios are consistent with local values except for lowest metallicity sight-lines.

Conclusion: First robust observational constraints show pristine HI gas drives highly efficient star formation with low dust obscuration, explaining UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.

Abstract: One of the major conundrums in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics is the apparent overabundance of a remarkable population of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 9$. We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z>9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$α$ (Ly$α$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\sim 10-100\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.
