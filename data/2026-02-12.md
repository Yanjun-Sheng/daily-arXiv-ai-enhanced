*Clémence Fontanive,Luigi R. Bedin,Mark W. Phillips,Michele Scalco,Loïc Albert,Daniella C. Bardalez Gagliuffi,Beth Biller*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: High-precision HST photometry of 21 Y dwarfs reveals tight sequences in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams, showing systematic discrepancies with current atmospheric models and highlighting missing physics in theoretical grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Y dwarfs (T_eff < 500K) serve as unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets, but their observational properties and atmospheric characteristics at these low temperatures remain poorly understood. Current atmospheric models show significant discrepancies with observations, necessitating high-precision, uniform datasets to provide empirical constraints for model improvement.

Method: Compiled uniform near-infrared photometry from Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters (F105W, F125W, F160W). Employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to achieve photometric uncertainties of 0.02-0.05 mag. Combined with precise parallax measurements to construct color-magnitude diagrams and compare with atmospheric models (ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, Lacy & Burrows).

Result: Revealed well-defined, tight Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams with minimal scatter. Confirmed known photometric trends: continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible reversal around 350K. Found systematic discrepancies between observations and models, particularly F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colors predicted too red by models. Low-metallicity grids provide best global fits, but these preferences likely reflect compensating effects from missing physics rather than true population-level abundances.

Conclusion: The tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions indicate that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current atmospheric models. High-precision, internally consistent datasets are crucial for tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures, despite expected atmospheric diversity among Y dwarfs.

Abstract: Y dwarfs represent the coldest class of brown dwarfs, with effective temperatures below 500K, and provide unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets. We present a large compilation of uniform near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters, including the F105W, F125W and F160W bands. We employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to reach photometric uncertainties at the 0.02-0.05 mag level for most targets. Combined with precise parallax measurements, our data reveal well-defined Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, observed with a markedly improved tightness. Known photometric trends emerge with minimal scatter, including the continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and the blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible hints of a reversal around 350K. Comparisons to the ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, and Lacy & Burrows atmospheric models highlight systematic discrepancies, in particular F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colours predicted to be too red. Low-metallicity grids provide the best fits to the global Y-dwarf population, although closer inspection across wavelengths shows that these preferences likely reflect compensating effects in missing or incomplete physics rather than true population-level abundances. While some atmospheric diversity is expected among Y dwarfs, their tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions reveal that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current grids. Our results underscore the importance of high-precision, internally consistent datasets in robustly tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures.

### [2] [Unipolarity of the solar magnetic field in equatorial coronal holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09199)
*Khagendra Katuwal,R. T. James McAteer*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study finds coronal holes exhibit significant magnetic polarity imbalance (20-45% flux imbalance) with asymmetric field distributions, unlike symmetric quiet-Sun regions, and shows moderate correlation between flux imbalance and high-speed solar wind stream speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the magnetic field characteristics beneath coronal holes, particularly the distribution of magnetic polarity and its potential relationship with high-speed solar wind streams, which could provide insights into solar wind acceleration mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed 70 coronal holes using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to examine photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B_LOS) distributions. Calculated skewness (S) values to quantify asymmetry and magnetic flux imbalance (Φ_imb). Compared with quiet-Sun regions and tracked temporal evolution of one coronal hole across half a solar rotation. Correlated flux imbalance with high-speed solar wind stream speeds.

Result: 88% of coronal holes showed significant magnetic polarity asymmetry with skewness values ±(0.20-0.40) and flux imbalance of 20-45%. Quiet-Sun regions were symmetric with skewness <0.11 and flux imbalance <11%. Magnetic field distribution remained stable over half a solar rotation. Moderate correlation (r=0.60) found between flux imbalance and high-speed solar wind stream speeds.

Conclusion: Coronal holes exhibit substantial magnetic flux imbalance indicating more open magnetic field structures compared to closed bipolar fields. This imbalance creates favorable conditions for plasma acceleration, contributing to faster solar wind streams, though the moderate correlation suggests additional factors also influence solar wind acceleration.

Abstract: A study of the unbalanced magnetic polarity distribution of 70 coronal holes was performed. Data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) were used to examine the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$) beneath these coronal holes. The skewness ($S$) values of the $B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ distributions revealed significant asymmetry, characterized by the dominance of one magnetic polarity, with $\sim88\%$ of the coronal holes exhibiting a skewness value ranging from $\pm(0.20~\text{to}~0.40)$. The corresponding magnetic flux imbalance ($Φ_{\mathrm{imb}}$) ranges from $20\%$ to $45\%$. In contrast, quiet-Sun regions show symmetric magnetic field distributions with skewness values less than$~0.11$ and flux imbalance less than $11.0\%$. A study of a coronal hole as it traverses across the disk shows that the magnetic field distribution does not evolve significantly over this time, remaining stable across half a solar rotation. A moderate correlation ($r = 0.60$) between the magnetic flux imbalance and the speed of associated high speed solar wind streams ($v_{\mathrm{HSS}}$) suggests that flux imbalance may contribute to the generation of these faster solar wind streams. These results imply that regions with higher flux imbalance ($Φ_{\mathrm{imb}}$), indicative of more open magnetic field structures, present more favorable conditions for plasma acceleration as compared to closed bi-polar field, but the moderate correlation indicates that other factors may also play important roles.

### [3] [Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09224)
*Mikko Tuomi,András Haris,Thomas Hackman*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of Kepler-411's photometry reveals starspot distribution and properties using spot modeling and transit mapping, finding rigid-body rotation (10.52±0.34 days) and no evidence for differential rotation, with spot occultations by planet c confirming model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Starspots and their movements provide crucial insights into stellar magnetic activity mechanisms. Understanding spot distribution and differential rotation offers important constraints for stellar magnetic dynamo behavior, particularly for exoplanet host stars like Kepler-411.

Method: Two independent complementary methods: 1) Modeling photometric effects of spot rotation using a comprehensive spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation, and spot evolution; 2) Spot mapping via transiting planets by detecting occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry.

Result: Spot models successfully reproduce observed photometric variations, providing information on spot distribution and movement. No evidence for differential rotation found - rotational profile consistent with rigid-body rotation (10.52±0.34 days). Three spot occultations by planet c detected, with positions coinciding well with larger spot structures identified in rotational modulation modeling.

Conclusion: Combined spot modeling and transit mapping provides robust characterization of stellar surface features on Kepler-411, revealing rigid-body rotation and validating spot model predictions through independent transit occultation detections, offering valuable constraints for understanding magnetic activity in exoplanet host stars.

Abstract: Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation -- the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.

### [4] [Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis Demonstrate that M_ejecta >> 11.3xM_accreted and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09377)
*Bradley E. Schaefer*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: T Pyxidis cannot become a Type Ia supernova because its ejected mass during recurrent nova eruptions is over 11 times greater than the mass accreted by the white dwarf, preventing mass accumulation needed for SNIa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether recurrent nova T Pyxidis can evolve into a Type Ia supernova by measuring whether the white dwarf gains or loses net mass over its eruption cycle, given the critical importance of SNIa progenitors in astrophysics.

Method: Used orbital period timing measurements from 1986 to 2025 to precisely determine mass ejected during the 2011 eruption, providing a novel technique that overcomes the >130× scatter of traditional methods for measuring ejecta mass.

Result: The mass ejected in one recurrent nova event is >2400×10⁻⁷ M⊙, with an extreme limit of ≫354×10⁻⁷ M⊙. Over all eruptions in a cycle, M_ejecta >17120×10⁻⁷ M⊙, while the white dwarf accreted only 220×10⁻⁷ M⊙, making M_ejecta ≫11.3×M_accreted.

Conclusion: T Pyxidis cannot become a Type Ia supernova because it loses far more mass than it gains, adding to the growing list of popular SNIa progenitor candidates that are proven incapable of evolving to supernovae.

Abstract: Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890--2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M_{\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $>$130$\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption. With simple and sure physics, the best estimate for the mass ejected by one RN event is $>$2400$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an extreme inviolate limit of $\gg$354$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over all eruptions in a cycle, $M_{ejecta}$$>$17120$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an inviolate limit of $M_{ejecta}$$\gg$2144$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over the full eruption cycle, the white dwarf accreted 220$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. So M$_{\rm ejecta}$$\gg$11.3$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, and T Pyx can never become a SNIa. This paper is the seventh in a series proving that each of various popular candidate SNIa progenitors cannot possibly evolve to a supernova; including V445 Pup, U Sco, T CrB, all symbiotic stars, FQ Cir, V1405 Cas, and now T Pyx.

### [5] [Spectroscopic He I 1083 nm prominence eruption observations in the middle corona with MLSO/UCoMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09390)
*Chloe Pistelli,Momchil E Molnar,Giuliana de Toma,Joseph Plowman*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: UCoMP observations detect neutral helium in eruptive prominences up to 2 solar radii, enabling velocity estimation and potential magnetic field inference for space weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMEs are major space weather drivers, and their magnetic fields are crucial for forecasting but difficult to measure. Neutral elements in cooler CME components could enable magnetic field inference through permitted transitions.

Method: Used the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) to observe eruptive prominences associated with CMEs in He I 1083 nm spectral line, tracking them through lower and middle corona up to ~2 solar radii.

Result: Solar prominence eruptions detected in He I 1083 nm up to instrument field of view edge (~2 solar radii), providing spectral information complementary to EUV and white-light observations. Enables line-of-sight velocity estimation of eruptive prominences.

Conclusion: UCoMP observations demonstrate capability to probe dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, potentially improving space weather forecasting through earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions and enabling magnetic field inference.

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather as they propagate through the heliosphere. Many CMEs have associated prominence material entangled in their magnetic structure which contains cooler plasma. This cooler CME component contains significant amounts of neutral elements, which emit brightly in permitted atomic lines. It has been hypothesized that permitted transitions of neutral elements in eruptions could be used for inferring the magnetic field in CMEs, which is crucial for space weather forecasting. We present observations made with the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) in He I 1083 nm that clearly show the presence of neutral helium in eruptive prominences associated with CMEs as they propagate through the lower and middle corona. We find that solar prominence eruptions can be detected in He I 1083 nm observations up to the edge of the instrument field of view at about 2 solar radii, providing valuable spectral information that complements existing extreme ultraviolet and white-light coronal imaging observatories. These results illustrate the capability of UCoMP to probe the dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, allowing for their line-of-sight velocity estimation, and potentially improving space weather forecasting by enabling earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions.

### [6] [A Deep Precursor-Dip-Main Superoutburst Sequence in VW Hydri Observed with TESS: High-Cadence Constraints on the Thermal-Tidal Instability Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09680)
*Bisi Bernard Ogunwale,Shara Michael,Avi Shporer,Dafne Guetta,Lev Tal-Or*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: TESS observations of VW Hydri superoutbursts reveal precursor-dip morphology predicted by thermal-tidal instability model, with superhump analysis yielding mass ratio q=0.131±0.002 and ruling out brown-dwarf donor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze high-cadence TESS observations of VW Hydri superoutbursts to test predictions of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model and determine system parameters through superhump analysis.

Method: Used 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts; performed sliding-window time-frequency analysis of superhumps; measured stabilized Stage A superhump periods to infer mass ratio; combined with white-dwarf mass priors and donor sequence to determine component masses.

Result: Two events showed precursor-dip morphology predicted by TTI model; superhump power detected during decline and near minimum light with smooth period evolution; mass ratio q=0.131±0.002; component masses M₁≈0.6-1.0M☉ and M₂≈0.08-0.14M☉, ruling out brown-dwarf donor.

Conclusion: VW Hydri exhibits TTI-predicted precursor-dip morphology, has mass ratio q=0.131, and serves as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-q dwarf novae.

Abstract: We present 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova VW Hydri. Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107~min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \simeq 0.6$--$1.0\,M_\odot$ and $M_2 \simeq 0.08$--$0.14\,M_\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW~Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae.

### [7] [Characterisation of an EXor outburst SPICY 97589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09777)
*Aaron Labdon,Rik Claes*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Characterization of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab as a new EXor-type episodic accretor with 2023 outburst showing 100× increase in accretion rate compared to quiescence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab, identify it as an EXor-type episodic accretor, and understand how accretion outbursts contribute to disk evolution in young stellar objects.

Method: Multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during peak outburst and post-outburst quiescence, using broad wavelength coverage for robust accretion rate measurements via known line tracers and stellar parameter determination.

Result: Identified as M3.0 type star (3410 K, 0.41 L⊙, 0.29 M⊙) with outburst accretion rate of 2.38±0.58×10⁻⁷ M⊙ yr⁻¹, two orders of magnitude greater than quiescent rate, confirming accretion-driven outburst with EXor-type spectral features including variable disk winds.

Conclusion: SPICY 97589 is confirmed as a new EXor-type episodic accretor where the 2023 outburst was driven by material influx from the surrounding environment to the central star, providing insights into accretion outburst mechanisms and disk evolution in young stellar objects.

Abstract: Stellar outbursts from variable or periodic accretion are thought to be ubiquitous across young stellar populations. However, relatively few outbursting objects have been discovered to date. Here, we present the characterisation of a new EXor-type episodic accretor. We aim to characterise the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab and characterise the stellar source for the first time, while exploring how an accretion outburst contributes to disk evolution. We employ multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during the peak of the 2023 outburst and the post-outburst quiescent object. The broad wavelength coverage of the dataset allows for robust measurements of the accretion rate using known line tracers. The addition of quiescent spectra provides a good estimation of stellar parameters of the central star while also informing us on the evolution of the disk during outburst phases. We find the stellar source to be a 3410\,K, M3.0 type star with a luminosity of 0.41 $L_\odot$ and an estimated stellar mass of 0.29 $M_\odot$. We measure the accretion rate of SPICY 97589 to be $\dot M = 2.38\pm0.58\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. This value is at two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent accretion rate. Thus, we confirm that the 2023 outburst was driven by an influx of material from the surrounding environment to the central star, an accretion outburst. The spectral fingerprint of emission lines is also characteristic of an outbursting EXor-type source, including variable disk winds.

TL;DR: Using low-frequency radio observations from OVRO-LWA to estimate coronal electron densities in the middle corona (1.7-3.5R⊙), demonstrating consistency with white-light coronagraph data and theoretical models, and providing a new density model for this region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional white-light coronal density estimates require simplifying assumptions that may affect measurement robustness. There is a need for complementary methods to improve reliability of coronal density measurements.

Method: Utilized low-frequency radio observations from the newly commissioned Long Wavelength Array at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA), a solar-dedicated radio interferometer that provides science-ready images with low latency.

Result: Successfully estimated coronal electron densities in the middle corona (1.7-3.5R⊙) that demonstrate consistency with white-light coronagraph data and theoretical model predictions. Derived a density model: ρ(r')=1.27r'^{-2}+29.02r'^{-4}+71.18r'^{-6}, where r'=r/R⊙.

Conclusion: OVRO-LWA is well-suited for generating regular, independent estimates of coronal densities to complement existing white-light techniques, providing a valuable alternative method for coronal density measurements.

Abstract: The electron density of the solar corona is a fundamental parameter in many areas of solar physics. Traditionally, routine estimates of coronal density have relied exclusively on white-light observations. However, these density estimates, obtained by inverting the white-light data, require simplifying assumptions, which may affect the robustness of the measurements. Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models. We also derive a density model valid between 1.7--3.5 $r_\odot$ and is given by $ρ(r')=1.27r'^{-2}+29.02r'^{-4}+71.18r'^{-6}$, where $r'=r/R_\odot$, and $r$ is the heliocentric distance. OVRO-LWA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer that provides science-ready images with low latency, making it well-suited for generating regular and independent estimates of coronal densities to complement existing white-light techniques.

### [9] [Searching for rotational X-ray modulation on TIC 277539431](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09835)
*Desmond Dsouza,Katja Poppenhaeger,Ekaterina Ilin*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: No rotational modulation detected in X-ray signal from TIC 277539431, an M7 dwarf with highest-latitude flare at 81°, despite updated rotation period of 273.593 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether coronal loops at high latitudes on fully-convective M dwarfs (unlike Sun's low-latitude sunspots) produce detectable rotational modulation in X-ray signals through occultation effects.

Method: Used TESS sectors 12, 37, 39, 64, and 65 to determine updated rotation period; conducted χ² fits varying amplitude and phase of sinusoidally modulated signal derived from new rotation period to search for X-ray rotational modulation.

Result: Found no evidence of rotational modulation in X-ray signal; updated rotation period is 273.593 minutes; possible explanations include lack of stable coronal loops during observation or signal too weak for detection.

Conclusion: Despite detecting highest-latitude flare at 81° on this fast-rotating M7 dwarf, no rotational X-ray modulation was observed, suggesting either transient coronal structures or insufficient signal strength for current dataset.

Abstract: TIC 277539431, a fast rotating M7 dwarf, was detected to host the highest latitude flare to date at $81^\circ$. Magnetic activity like stellar flares occurring at high latitude indicate occurrence of coronal loops at these latitudes on fully-convective M dwarfs. In contrast, sunspots usually occur below $30^\circ$. In our study we look for modulation on the X-ray signal occurring due to occultation of coronal loops by the star due to stellar rotation. We report an updated rotation period for this star as $P_{\text{rot}}=273.593$ min based on TESS sectors 12, 37, 39, 64 and 65. We conducted $χ^2_{\textrm{red}}$ fits by varying the amplitude and the phase of a sinusoidally modulated signal derived from the new rotation period. We find no evidence of rotational modulation in the X-ray signal. This could be due to multiple scenarios, such as lack of a stable coronal loop during observation or the modulated signal being too weak, however given the dataset, individual scenarios cannot be distinguished.

TL;DR: Multi-wavelength observations of low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a complex outflow structure with nested excitation and velocity patterns, suggesting magnetohydrodynamic wind launching mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the earliest stages of star and planet formation by examining the connection between accretion, outflow, and disk evolution through detailed observations of a low-luminosity Class 0 protostar.

Method: Combined ALMA eDisk large program and JWST cycle-1 GO program IPA observations of IRAS 16253-2429, using scattered light imaging (≤5 μm) and detection of 15 pure rotational H₂ transitions to analyze continuum cavity and molecular outflow structure.

Result: Revealed hourglass-shaped continuum cavity with brighter northern side; detected wide-angle molecular outflow with width ≤35 au at protostellar location; found nested excitation structure with opening angles narrowing from 40-35° for low-J H₂ lines to 28-19° for high-J lines; observed velocity increase with excitation energy from ~12.5 km/s to ~28.5 km/s.

Conclusion: The nested excitation and velocity structure suggests magnetohydrodynamic wind launching mechanism, similar to other protostars and Class II sources; lower velocity CO may represent infalling envelope gas accelerated outward by wide-angle wind along cavity walls.

Abstract: Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow and disk evolution. We present results from the observations of the low luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}\sim~0.2~L_\odot$) and mass (M$_*\sim$\,0.15~M$_\odot$) Class~0 protostar IRAS 16253$-$2429, conducted as part of the \textit{eDisk} ALMA large program and the JWST cycle-1 GO program \textit{IPA}. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at $\leq$~5~$μ$m), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H$_2$ transitions (E$_\mathrm{up}$:~1015--21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. {The outflow width (as traced in H$_2$~0-0~S(11)) at the protostellar location measures $\leq$35 au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters ($\sim$30 au) but wider than the 20--23~au jet width in [Fe II].} {The opening angle narrows from 40--35\arcdeg{} for the low-J H$_2$ lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component (ALMA $^{12}$CO) to $\sim$28--19\arcdeg{} for the high-J H$_2$ lines (S(7)--S(11)).} Position-velocity diagrams of H$_2$ reveal higher velocities for higher E$_{up}$, ranging from ~12.5 km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to ~28.5 km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(5)~and~S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide angle wind suggest a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to the findings in other protostars and Class II sources. The lower velocity mm CO may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outwards by the wide angle wind along the cavity walls.

*Malay Shukla,Sneha Pandit,Nitin Yadav*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher magnetic contrast than conventional 430.5 nm filters, especially at narrow widths, due to higher formation height and temperature sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the diagnostic potential of the G-band at 430.4 nm for probing small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere, comparing it with the conventional 430.5 nm filter.

Method: Combined 3D MHD simulations from MURaM code with spectral synthesis via RH 1.5D code to evaluate intensity contrast in G-band filtergrams at both wavelengths.

Result: Filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths, due to slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions.

Conclusion: G-band filtergrams at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential for solar magnetic field studies and have potential applications in stellar contexts where molecular bands serve as proxies for magnetic activity.

Abstract: We investigate the diagnostic potential of the G-band at 430.4 nm for probing small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. Combining three-dimensional MHD simulations from the MURaM code and spectral synthesis via the RH 1.5D code, we evaluate the intensity contrast in the G-band filtergrams by comparing the filter centered at 430.4 nm in comparison to the conventional 430.5 nm. Our results show that filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths. This enhancement arises from its slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions. These findings indicate that G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential under the assumptions of the present modeling. The obtained results are also relevant and suggest potential applications in stellar contexts, where molecular bands are often used as proxies for magnetic activity.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of eclipsing binary DD CrB reveals a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a ~13-year orbit as the best explanation for observed eclipse timing variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate eclipse timing variations (ETVs) in the eclipsing binary system DD CrB, which consists of a B-type subdwarf primary and M-type main-sequence secondary, and to determine the cause of these timing variations.

Method: Combined multi-color photometric observations, radial velocity measurements, and precise TESS eclipse timings to constrain system parameters. Used Romer delay between primary and secondary minima to determine mass ratio, then performed simultaneous modeling of light and radial velocity curves with PHOEBE 2.17. Fixed secondary albedo to maximum physically plausible value (A₂ = 1.0) to break degeneracy between albedo, surface temperature, and radius.

Result: Obtained mass ratio q = 0.299 ± 0.009, secondary temperature T₂ ~ 2360 K, and radius R₂ ~ 0.16 R⊙ consistent with literature. Eclipse timing variations best explained by a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a ~13-year orbit, with eccentric models (e ~ 0.46) providing better fit statistics than circular models.

Conclusion: The observed eclipse timing variations in DD CrB are primarily caused by light travel time effects due to a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion orbiting the binary system with a period of approximately 13 years, with eccentric orbital models providing the best fit to the data.

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the eclipsing binary DD CrB, composed of a B-type subdwarf primary and an M-type main-sequence secondary, with the main goal of investigating its eclipse timing variations (ETVs). Our new multi-color photometric observations, radial velocity measurements, and precise eclipse timings from TESS allow us to constrain the system parameters. The Romer delay between primary and secondary minima yields a mass ratio of $q = 0.299 \pm 0.009$, enabling robust simultaneous modeling of the light and radial velocity curves with {\sc phoebe} 2.17. By fixing the albedo of the secondary to its maximum physically plausible value (A$_2 = 1.0$), despite the degeneracy between albedo, surface temperature, and radius, we obtained a satisfactory fit, resulting in a significantly lower temperature ($T_2 \sim 2360$ K) and a radius ($R_2 \sim 0.16$ R$_\odot$) in agreement with literature values. Using the total mass of the components and the orbital size derived from this modeling, we interpret the ETVs and find them best explained by a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a $\sim13$-year orbit in all competing models, while the eccentric (e $\sim0.46$) models perform better in terms of fit statistics.

*Sandeep Dubey,Christian Beck,Rahul Yadav,Tobias Felipe,Shibu K Mathew*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Solar pore flashes exhibit cooler photospheres, stronger magnetic fields, persistent upflows, and are co-spatial with enhanced 3-5 minute oscillations, showing confined chromospheric heating with strong downflows flanking central upflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the physical properties and atmospheric impact of flashes in solar pores, which are strongly magnetized regions lacking penumbrae, using multi-wavelength observations to understand their thermal, magnetic, and dynamic behavior across different atmospheric layers.

Method: Multi-line study using high-resolution observations from Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in Fe I 6302 Å, Ca II 8542 Å and K, and H-β, complemented by (E)UV data from IRIS and SDO/AIA. Bisector analysis and spectral inversions with SIR and NICOLE were used to infer stratifications of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic field.

Result: Flashes exhibit cooler photospheric temperatures (ΔT ≈ 400 K), stronger magnetic fields (ΔB ≈ 250 G), larger inclinations (~25° vs ~18°), and persistent upflows (~0.5 km s⁻¹). They show enhanced 3- and 5-minute power in photosphere, with only 3-minute power in chromosphere. Flashes display central chromospheric upflows (~1 km s⁻¹) flanked by strong downflows (~8 km s⁻¹), with temperature enhancements reaching ~500 K at logτ ≈ -5 and ~2500 K at logτ ≈ -6. Flashes correspond one-to-one with radially outward running waves near pore boundary (5-15 km s⁻¹).

Conclusion: Pore flashes are confined to the lower and mid-chromosphere with little influence on higher atmospheric layers, as indicated by strong Ca II core emission, occasional Stokes V reversals, and H-β enhancements. They represent localized chromospheric heating events associated with wave phenomena at pore boundaries.

Abstract: Solar pores are strongly magnetized regions lacking a photospheric penumbra and characterized by predominantly vertical magnetic fields. We present a multi-line study of flashes in a solar pore using high-resolution observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in Fe~\textsc{i}~6302~Å, Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~Å and K, and H-$β$, complemented by (E)UV data from \textit{IRIS} and \textit{SDO}/AIA. Bisector analysis and spectral inversions with \textsc{SIR} and \textsc{NICOLE} were used to infer stratifications of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic field. Flashes, confined to one half of the pore, exhibit cooler photospheric temperatures ($ΔT \approx 400$~K), stronger magnetic fields ($ΔB \approx 250$~G), larger inclinations ($\sim25^{\circ}$ versus $\sim18^{\circ}$), and persistent upflows ($\sim0.5$~km~s$^{-1}$) compared to the quiescent pore. They are co-spatial with enhanced 3- and 5-minute power in the photosphere, while only 3-minute power persists in the chromosphere. Flashes are detected down to $\sim50\%$ line depth in Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~Å intensity and show central chromospheric upflows ($\sim1$~km~s$^{-1}$) flanked by strong downflows ($\sim8$~km~s$^{-1}$). Temperature enhancements reach $\sim500$~K at $\logτ\approx -5$ and $\sim2500$~K at $\logτ\approx -6$, with a bimodal velocity distribution. Flashes correspond one-to-one with radially outward running waves near the pore boundary (5--15~km~s$^{-1}$). Strong Ca~\textsc{ii} core emission, occasional Stokes~$V$ reversals, and H-$β$ enhancements indicate that pore flashes are confined to the lower and mid-chromosphere, with little influence on higher atmospheric layers.

*R. Murillo-Ojeda,F. M. Jiménez-Esteban,A. Rebassa-Mansergas,S. Torres*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: This paper presents the largest, most complete catalogue of white dwarfs with infrared excess emission within 100 parsecs, identifying 456 sources (292 robust, 164 candidates) with 75% being new discoveries, revealing a higher infrared excess fraction than previous estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared excess in white dwarfs indicates debris disks or substellar companions, providing crucial insights into extrasolar planetary material and binary evolution. However, fully characterizing these systems requires a statistically significant, complete sample, which has been lacking.

Method: Built spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using synthetic photometry from Gaia DR3 low-resolution spectra across 56 J-PAS optical filters, complemented with latest infrared photometry from Virtual Observatory. Used VOSA to fit SEDs with appropriate WD atmospheric models based on spectral type. Performed visual inspection of optical/infrared images to identify contaminated photometry.

Result: Created catalogue of 456 infrared excess white dwarfs (292 robust identifications, 164 candidates) with 351 (~75%) being new discoveries. Found infrared excess fraction between 5.9±0.3% and 9.2±0.4%, higher than previous estimates. Discovered that for infrared excess WDs, the fraction with non-hydrogen atmospheres increases with Gaia GBP-GRP color, contrary to general WD population trend.

Conclusion: This work provides the largest, most complete and reliable sample of white dwarfs with infrared excess within 100 pc to date. Due to their proximity, these systems are ideal targets for follow-up studies to characterize circumstellar disks, substellar companions, and accreted planetary material composition.

Abstract: The presence of infrared excess flux observed in white dwarfs (WDs) is related to the existence of debris disks or substellar companions. These systems provide important clues in the study of extrasolar planetary material and binary evolution. However, fully characterising their properties requires a statistically significant, complete sample. This work aims to identify a complete sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc of the Sun. We built the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the WDs using synthetic photometry in 56 optical filters of the J-PAS system, generated from Gaia Data Release 3 low-resolution spectra and complemented with the latest infrared photometry available at the Virtual Observatory (VO). VOSA was used to fit the SEDs with different atmospheric WD models depending on the source spectral type. We visually checked optical and infrared images to identify contaminated photometry. We built a catalogue of 456 infrared excess WDs, of which 292 are robust identifications, and 164 are candidates. 351 ($\sim$75%) are new identifications. This implies a fraction of infrared excess WDs between 5.9$\pm$0.3% and 9.2$\pm$0.4%, higher than previous works, but in agreement with some more recent estimates. Furthermore, for the sample of infrared excess WDs, the fraction of sources with non-hydrogen atmosphere increases with the Gaia GBP-GRP colour, contrary to the general WD population. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, a thorough comparison of our catalogue with those of previous studies was performed. The sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc presented in this work is the largest, most complete and reliable to date. Due to their proximity, they are ideal targets for follow-up studies aimed at characterising circumstellar disks, substellar companions, and the composition of accreted planetary material.

### [15] [Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. IV. Type Ia supernovae: Na I D line strength relating to external material and intrinsic properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10084)
*Santiago González-Gaitán,Claudia P. Gutiérrez,João Duarte,Rita Santos,Gonçalo Martins,Joseph P. Anderson,Lluís Galbany*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: SNe Ia show two distinct environmental populations with different sodium absorption patterns linked to intrinsic properties, suggesting asymmetric radiation interacting with nearby material in young environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive study, Type Ia supernova progenitors and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. The paper aims to investigate relationships between interstellar absorption features and SN properties to better understand progenitor systems and explosion physics.

Method: Analyzed a large sample of SNe Ia, comparing narrow interstellar absorption features (particularly sodium) with photometric/spectroscopic properties and environmental characteristics. Used clustering analysis to identify distinct populations based on sodium strength, ejecta velocity, extinction, and environmental parameters.

Result: Found strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations: old (low extinction, normal velocity) and young. The young population splits into two subgroups: highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe with strong blueshifted sodium absorption, and low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. Sodium absorption correlates with both environment and intrinsic properties independently.

Conclusion: The relationship between intervening material and intrinsic properties suggests that young SNe Ia in star-forming environments have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, with observables depending on viewing angle. The cosmological mass-step is consistent with these identified populations.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.

TL;DR: JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy identifies six galaxy overdensities at z~5.5-7 in Abell 2744 field, revealing their properties and neutral gas distribution during reionization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct blind search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities (proto-clusters) during reionization epoch (z~5.5-7) to understand their role in cosmic star formation and reionization, overcoming limitations of pre-JWST LAE-only searches.

Method: Blind unbiased search using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of Abell 2744 lensing field (JWST-ALT survey). Applied cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends algorithm to identify overdensities. Used rest-frame optical selection to characterize galaxy properties and infer neutral gas distribution via Lyman-α emitters and damped Lyman-α absorbers.

Result: Identified six galaxy overdensities (five robust at z=5.66-6.77) with halo masses ≳10¹¹ M⊙. Overdensity galaxies are less massive but equally metal-rich with younger stellar populations than field galaxies. Two overdensities show excess H I absorption compared to field average, revealing neutral gas distribution in high-z overdensities.

Conclusion: First direct constraints on neutral gas tomography in z>5 galaxy overdensities, demonstrating limitations of LAE-only searches and highlighting JWST's capability for rest-frame optical selection of reionization-era proto-clusters.

Abstract: The high-redshift progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters are believed to substantially contribute to the global star-formation rate density and drive the large-scale reionization of the Universe. Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$α$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$α$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \hi\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z>5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: SEEDZ simulations show that massive black holes grow to ~10⁶ M☉ by z=12.5 via super-Eddington accretion bursts, with growth limited by their own feedback rather than external factors, suggesting either weaker early feedback or a two-step galaxy formation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the growth mechanisms and feedback effects of massive black holes in the early Universe, particularly how they reach observed masses by high redshifts and what processes regulate their growth.

Method: Analysis using SEEDZ simulations that model massive black hole growth and feedback, tracking accretion bursts, energy injection, and gas dynamics in early galaxy halos.

Result: Massive black holes reach ~10⁶ M☉ by z=12.5 through 5-30 Myr super-Eddington accretion bursts. Growth is limited by MBH feedback, which evacuates gas from host halos despite weak feedback models. Maximum masses are set by feedback modeling and halo binding potential.

Conclusion: Either MBH feedback in the early ΛCDM Universe is weaker than assumed, or high-redshift JWST galaxies formed via a two-step process where MBHs first quench then later reconstitute gas reservoirs. Maximum black hole masses before z=12.5 shouldn't significantly exceed 10⁶ M☉ unless feedback is extremely ineffective.

Abstract: Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\sim10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: RQ-NLSy1 galaxies show optical and MIR variability suggesting non-thermal contributions from weak/intermittent jets alongside thermal disk emission, challenging the view that they are purely disk-dominated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of flux variations in RQ-NLSy1 galaxies and assess relative contributions of accretion disk vs. possible jet-related components, given recurring 37 GHz radio flares suggesting non-thermal processes.

Method: Systematic optical (ZTF g,r,i bands) and MIR (WISE W1,W2 bands) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling. Quantified optical variability using FAGN-test, peak-to-peak amplitude, fractional variability; MIR variability using redshift-corrected intrinsic amplitudes. Analyzed timescales from intra-night to long-term.

Result: All RQ-NLSy1s show significant long-term optical variability with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability across optical bands. Intrinsic MIR variability detected in 3/4 sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags observed. Optical variability anti-correlated with Eddington ratio, positively correlated with black hole mass.

Conclusion: A subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring needed to better constrain origin of variations.

Abstract: Radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s) are generally considered to be dominated by thermal emission from the accretion disk. However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations.

*Albert Raymond Penner*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A modified GRAS/AQUAL field equation with one free parameter extends MONDian theories to galaxy clusters, addressing their failure to explain missing mass in clusters while maintaining agreement with galactic dynamics and solar system constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MONDian theories (AQUAL and GRAS) successfully explain galactic dynamics without dark matter but fail to account for missing mass in galaxy clusters. The authors aim to develop a modified version that works for both scales.

Method: Develop a modified GRAS/AQUAL field equation with a single free parameter. Apply this to galaxy clusters while testing against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Analyze the resulting difference between galactic and cluster Radial Acceleration Relationships (RAR).

Result: The modified field equation successfully extends to galaxy clusters while maintaining agreement with galactic observations and solar system constraints. It provides an explanation for the difference between galactic and cluster RARs.

Conclusion: A single-parameter modification to GRAS/AQUAL field equations can reconcile MONDian theories with both galactic and cluster-scale observations, potentially offering a unified alternative to dark matter across different astrophysical scales.

Abstract: The MONDian theory of AQUAL (AQUAdratic Lagrangian) and the theory of GRAS (GRavitational Anti-Screening) are alternatives to the theory of dark matter. When these theories are applied to galaxy dynamics they are in excellent agreement with observations including the galactic RAR (Radial Acceleration Relationship). However, when applied to galaxy clusters they do not explain the bulk of the missing mass. This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters.

### [20] [Are carbon deflagration supernovae triggered by dark matter ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09274)
*Jeremy Mould*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Primordial black holes colliding with white dwarfs in the Galactic bulge can trigger type Ia supernovae through thermal energy deposition, with future Rubin telescope data potentially confirming this mechanism via radial distribution analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether collisions between stellar remnants (white dwarfs) and dark matter (primordial black holes) in the Galactic bulge could trigger type Ia supernovae, and to determine if observational evidence supports this collisional triggering mechanism.

Method: Analyzes the thermal energy deposition from primordial black hole collisions with white dwarfs, considering gravitational focusing effects and degenerate core thermodynamics. Compares predicted radial distribution of type Ia supernovae (more centrally concentrated) with current observational data and anticipates future Rubin telescope observations.

Result: Lunar-mass primordial black holes can raise white dwarf core temperatures by at least 1°C through kinetic energy thermalization. Current observational data on supernova radial distributions is inconclusive, but future Rubin telescope samples of millions of supernovae will provide definitive evidence.

Conclusion: Collisions between primordial black holes and white dwarfs represent a plausible mechanism for triggering type Ia supernovae, with future large-scale observations from the Rubin telescope expected to confirm or refute this hypothesis based on radial distribution patterns.

Abstract: Collisions between stellar remnants and dark matter in the Galactic bulge are frequent, and the kinetic energy of a primordial black hole incident on a white dwarf, if it is all thermalized, will raise the degenerate core's temperature, by at least a degree in the case of a lunar mass black hole. This is an underestimate in two ways: the specific heat is less than 3k/2 per particle, and the incoming object is accelerated by gravitational focusing. Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A new method for selecting Post-StarBurst galaxies using spatially-resolved star formation histories from IFS data identifies 107 PSB galaxies, revealing diverse spatial patterns and challenging previous assumptions about age gradients and AGN prevalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand galaxy evolution to quiescence by developing a more direct PSB selection method based on inferred star formation histories rather than spectral features, and to study spatially-resolved PSB properties using IFS data.

Method: Uses SFH measurements from MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ IFS surveys processed with Pipe3D pipeline. Introduces new PSB selection method based directly on inferred SFHs rather than spectral feature cutoffs. Examines spatially-resolved star formation on galaxy scale to identify PSB regions.

Result: Identified 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which overlap with known PSBs from other methods. Found diverse spatial patterns: centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels in quiescent ellipticals, ring-like PSB spaxels with inside-out age gradients (contrary to literature), and widespread PSB regions with ongoing star formation elsewhere. No significant Seyfert 2 PSB population found.

Conclusion: The SFH-based PSB selection method is effective and unbiased against AGN, revealing a broader PSB population than traditional methods. PSB galaxies exhibit diverse spatial patterns, and strong AGN activity appears uncommon during the PSB phase. The discovery of inside-out age gradients challenges previous observations.

Abstract: Post-StarBurst (PSB) galaxies are galaxies that have undergone a large burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching. Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.

### [22] [A Monopolar Jet from Protostar HOPS 10: Evidence for Asymmetric Magnetized Launching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09404)
*Somnath Dutta*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA observations reveal a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet in HOPS 10, challenging the typical bipolar jet paradigm and suggesting intrinsically asymmetric mass loading from the circumstellar disk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how protostars accrete mass while removing angular momentum, specifically investigating the launching mechanism of protostellar jets which are crucial for angular momentum extraction but poorly constrained.

Method: High-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from protostar HOPS 10, providing excellent spatial and velocity resolution to trace both entrained outflow and collimated jet.

Result: Discovery of a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s⁻¹, while low-velocity outflow (-20 to +30 km s⁻¹) is bipolar. The monopolarity is consistent across all tracers (CO and SiO), with SiO confirming a genuine collimated jet rather than cloud contamination.

Conclusion: The observed monopolar jet cannot be explained by obscuration or geometry given the edge-on orientation and low extinction. Intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for this unprecedented monopolar jet morphology.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in star formation is understanding how a protostar accretes mass from its circumstellar disk while removing excess angular momentum. Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity.

### [23] [A deep MeerKAT view of associated HI absorption in radio AGNs at intermediate redshift: Role of absorber geometry and conditions of the gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09478)
*Raffaella Morganti,Tom Oosterloo,Clive Tadhunter,Suma Murthy*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: MeerKAT HI absorption survey of 17 powerful radio sources at z~0.25-0.7 reveals 3 detections, including 2 associated absorptions in young radio sources and 1 local intervening system, showing detection depends on radio source evolution, gas conditions, and geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for HI absorption in powerful radio sources at intermediate redshifts (0.25<z<0.7) and connect HI presence/absence to AGN and host galaxy properties, particularly investigating how radio source evolution, physical conditions, and gas geometry affect detection rates.

Method: Used MeerKAT observations of 17 powerful radio sources (L_1.4GHz > 10^27 W Hz^-1) at intermediate redshifts, obtaining 15 RFI-free spectra with extremely low optical depth sensitivity (τ_peak < 0.005). Sample characterized at radio and optical wavelengths, consisting mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars.

Result: Three new HI absorption detections: two associated absorptions in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09) with detection rate of 13%±7%, and one local intervening system (PKS 0405-12). Both associated detections have UV luminosity below 10^23 W Hz^-1, suggesting gas not ionized by AGN radiation. PKS 1151-34 is a quasar with HI likely in circumnuclear disc, while PKS 1306-09 shows highly blueshifted HI indicative of jet-driven outflow.

Conclusion: HI absorption detection in associated systems depends on combination of radio source evolutionary status, physical conditions, and gas geometry. Young radio sources are more often detected in HI than evolved ones. Results resemble low-redshift findings, indicating similar physical processes across cosmic time.

Abstract: We present MeerKAT observations searching for HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}> 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25<z<0.7$). The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\%\pm 7\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Spectral line analysis of hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 using Herschel/HIFI data reveals molecular abundances, excitation conditions, and complex outflow dynamics with warm (30-65 K) and hot (90-250 K) temperature components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories, specifically in the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03.

Method: Utilized archival Herschel Space Observatory HIFI data for spectral line analysis, employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework for accurate column density and temperature inference, and performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain global physical parameters.

Result: Detected multiple molecular species including CO isotopologues, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: warm (30-65 K) and hot (90-250 K). Velocity profiles show narrow blueshifted components linked to outer outflow layers and redshifted wings indicating inner outflow activity.

Conclusion: G10 exhibits a complex dynamical environment with dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores and a warm, less dense envelope. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions, highlighting the core's active star-forming nature.

Abstract: We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.

### [25] [Organic Acid Chemistry in ISM: Detection of Formic Acid and its Prebiotic Chemistry in Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09656)
*Arijit Manna,Sabyasachi Pal,Sekhar Sinha,Sushanta Kumar Mondal*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: First detection of trans-formic acid (t-HCOOH) in hot molecular core G358.93-0.03 MM1 using ALMA observations, with chemical modeling supporting grain-surface formation via HCO + OH reaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formic acid is important for glycine synthesis in interstellar chemistry, and its detection in hot molecular cores can reveal oxygen-bearing molecule involvement in star formation regions.

Method: High-resolution ALMA Band 7 observations of G358.93-0.03 MM1, combined with three-phase warm-up chemical modeling using UCLCHEM gas-grain chemical code.

Result: Detected t-HCOOH with column density (8.13±0.72)×10¹⁵ cm⁻², excitation temperature 120±15 K, fractional abundance (2.62±0.29)×10⁻⁹ relative to H₂. Modeled and observed abundances match within factor 0.89.

Conclusion: HCOOH likely forms on grain surfaces via HCO + OH reaction and is subsequently released to gas phase, supporting grain-surface chemistry in hot molecular cores.

Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: NGC 5938 shows extended radio emission from an AGN jet with steep spectral index, coexisting with star formation traced by infrared emission, and the jet appears confined by an X-ray gas halo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of radio emission in NGC 5938 and determine the relative contributions from AGN activity versus star formation processes.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis using EMU radio data, DECaPS2 optical, WISE infrared, and eROSITA X-ray observations, including spectral index measurements and spatial correlation studies.

Result: Detection of extended radio jet (8.2 kpc, α = -1.2 ± 0.2) indicative of AGN synchrotron emission, with infrared evidence of star formation, and X-ray emission enveloping the radio jet suggesting confinement.

Conclusion: NGC 5938 exhibits both AGN jet activity and ongoing star formation, with the jet confined by a larger X-ray gas halo, demonstrating complex AGN-star formation interplay similar to other known systems.

Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.

### [27] [Global statistical entropy and its implications for the main sequences of stars and galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09663)
*David Elbaz*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Stars and galaxies produce entropy by emitting photons, with main-sequence stars generating similar specific entropy per unit mass, suggesting universal entropy production in cosmic structure formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dissipative systems like stars and galaxies produce entropy through photon emission, and how this relates to structure formation and the Second Law of Thermodynamics in a cosmological context.

Method: Define a global entropy using statistical approach accounting for both matter particles and photons, treating radiation as a photon gas. Analyze specific entropy production by stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram main sequence and examine implications for star-formation main sequence in galaxies.

Result: Stars generate nearly equal amount of specific entropy (comparable photons per unit mass) over their main-sequence lifetimes, suggesting the HR diagram main sequence constitutes a locus of convergence toward universal specific entropy production. Similar results found for star-formation main sequence in galaxies, with low-frequency photons dominating extragalactic background light.

Conclusion: Structure formation in cosmic history reflects the Second Law, as organized matter efficiently generates entropy through emission of lower-frequency photons. This perspective may inform possibilities for life elsewhere in the universe through entropy production mechanisms.

Abstract: In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Two H II region catalogs with azimuthal resolution for galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946 were created, enabling study of star-forming processes, metallicity gradients, and discovery of high-metallicity structures linked to spiral arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study star-forming processes in spiral galaxies by creating high-resolution catalogs of H II regions in two grand design galaxies (NGC 628 and NGC 6946) and analyzing their properties including metallicity distributions and gradients.

Method: Direct imaging in narrow-band filters (Hα, Hβ, [O II]λ3727, [O III]λλ4959,5007) and continua; data calibration/correction; measurement of de-reddened fluxes, sizes, Hα equivalent widths; metallicity determination using two empirical calibrations; 2D metallicity mapping using Delaunay triangulation.

Result: Catalogs of 209 H II regions for NGC 628 and 226 for NGC 6946; radial gradients of Hα equivalent width, excitation, and oxygen abundance; 2D metallicity/excitation maps; ~0.6 dex difference between two metallicity calibrations; discovery of high-metallicity knots in NGC 628 and azimuthal structure in NGC 6946 linked to spiral arms.

Conclusion: High-metallicity structures in spiral arms likely result from increased temperatures of ionizing clusters in H II regions, possibly due to variations in initial mass functions between arm and interarm regions; oxygen abundance gradients consistent with previous studies but with larger sample sizes.

Abstract: We present here two H II region catalogues with azimuthal resolution for the two grand design galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946. With the help of these catalogues, we study several properties of the star-forming processes occurring in spiral galaxies. We obtained direct imaging in the narrow-band filters centred at Hα, H\b{eta}, [O II]λ3727, and [O III]λλ4959, 5007 and their respective continua. After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions.

*Sambaran Banerjee*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: N-body simulations of young massive clusters evolving into open clusters show they produce 25-33% of observed gravitational-wave binary black hole mergers, with distinctive mass ratio and spin distributions matching some LVK observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the contribution of young massive clusters evolving into old open clusters (YMC/OC channel) to the observed gravitational-wave compact binary merger population detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observatories.

Method: Homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters computed with direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7, spanning initial masses 10^4-10^5 M⊙, half-mass radii 1-3 pc, and metallicities 0.0002-0.02. Simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant models forming black holes and neutron stars, BH spin prescriptions, GW recoil kicks, and evolve until BH depletion.

Result: Most GW mergers are dynamically assembled binary black holes merging within host clusters; mass ratios down to 0.1-0.2; merger efficiency peaks at M_cl(0)=7.5×10^4 M⊙ and for M_cl(0)≤3.0×10^4 M⊙; reproduces key LVK features including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning massive BHs, and 30 M⊙ primary excess; accounts for 25-33% of observed merger rate density; effective spin distribution positively asymmetric at z=0 and broadens with redshift.

Conclusion: The YMC/OC channel contributes significantly (25-33%) to the observed GW merger population, reproducing several key observational features, though under-production of 10 M⊙ primaries suggests contributions from other formation channels are needed.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]

TL;DR: Massive disk galaxies from IllustrisTNG50 simulation show double-exponential structure with central HSB disk and extended LSB disk, similar to observed giant LSB galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether cosmological simulations can form disk galaxies with both high surface brightness (HSB) central disks and extended low surface brightness (LSB) disks, similar to observed giant LSB galaxies.

Method: Analyzed massive disk galaxies (stellar mass ≥10¹¹ M⊙) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, performed 2D structural decomposition using synthetic SDSS images at z=0.

Result: Found galaxies with central HSB disks surrounded by extended LSB disks, hosted by dark matter halos of ~10¹² M⊙. Rotation velocities: 300-500 km/s. Stellar-to-dark matter ratio: 0.04-0.46, baryon-to-dark matter ratio: 0.07-0.47.

Conclusion: Cosmological simulations can successfully form disk galaxies with HSB+LSB disk structures, matching observational characteristics of giant LSB galaxies.

Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$>=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.

TL;DR: Using CNN ensemble learning on HSC-SSP DR3 optical data, researchers detected 4.5× more cirrus filaments than previous studies, revealing sky background oversubtraction issues affecting faint object photometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galactic optical cirrus interferes with observations of faint Galactic and extragalactic objects, necessitating improved detection methods to understand their impact on astronomical data analysis.

Method: Employed convolutional neural networks with ensemble learning on HSC-SSP DR3 optical images (g, r, i bands) to segment cirrus filaments from foreground/background objects across the entire survey.

Result: Detected 4.5 times more cirrus clouds than previous SDSS Stripe~82 studies; identified systematic oversubtraction of sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images, causing up to 0.5 magnitude dimming for objects near large filaments.

Conclusion: Cirrus clouds must be considered in sky background estimation algorithms; provided catalog of filaments and training framework for neural network cirrus segmentation in HSC-SSP data.

Abstract: The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images.

Motivation: NGC 1097's circumnuclear star-forming ring provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions, particularly in relation to nuclear activity, metallicity effects, and feedback processes in barred spiral galaxies.

Method: Used MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations to identify and analyze 24 individual HII regions within the circumnuclear ring (385 pc to 1.3 kpc). Applied direct abundance derivation techniques and photoionisation modeling to interpret emission-line ratios.

Result: Found purely photoionised HII regions with supersolar metallicities (highest exceeding 5× solar value). Discovered break in ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation at high metallicity. Young stars ionise 8% of total ring gas. Evidence supports propagating starburst scenario from nucleus to ring via bar-driven shocks. Likely detected optical signatures of one of the galaxy's jets.

Conclusion: The study reveals extreme metallicity conditions in NGC 1097's circumnuclear ring, demonstrates metallicity-dependent changes in ionisation structure, supports bar-driven propagating star formation, and shows evidence of feedback processes operating on small galactic scales.

Abstract: The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.

TL;DR: First spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the Helix Nebula using SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper data reveals detailed ionization stratification, faint auroral line morphology, and confirms low dust content with homogeneous electron temperature/density across the main ring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the diagnostic power of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) for extended nebulae by applying the LVM Data Analysis Pipeline to obtain the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in the archetypal Helix Nebula.

Method: Used spatially resolved spectroscopic data from SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper covering full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over ~0.5 degree field. Applied LVM Data Analysis Pipeline (LVM-DAP) to create hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species.

Result: Revealed well-known ionization stratification from compact He++ core to bright [O III] ring and extended low-ionization envelope. Detected numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines ([O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, He I) across nebula. Derived radial trends confirm remarkably low dust content and overall homogeneity of electron temperature/density across main ring. Hα kinematics support slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell scenario.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LVM spectroscopy's diagnostic power for extended nebulae and its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures, enabling detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy.

Abstract: We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) using data from the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM), by applying the recently developed LVM Data Analysis Pipeline (LVM-DAP). Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures.

TL;DR: Cloud-wind interaction simulations show resolution dependence varies by regime: radiative subsonic cases converge at low resolution (4 cells/radius), while supersonic destruction requires much higher resolution (>48 cells/radius) for convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how numerical resolution affects cloud survival and acceleration in cloud-wind interactions, particularly since mixing rates in simulations are sensitive to smallest resolved scales and resolution-cloud evolution relationship is under-explored.

Method: Conducted cloud-crushing simulations with varying numerical resolution, modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases in subsonic and supersonic wind regimes to analyze effects on cloud survival and acceleration.

Result: Resolution requirements differ significantly by regime: radiative subsonic cases show convergence at only 4 cells per cloud radius for mass growth and acceleration, while supersonic cases show clear resolution dependence with no convergence even at 48 cells per radius for cloud destruction and velocity.

Conclusion: No single resolution requirement applies to all cloud-wind interaction scenarios; accurately capturing cloud destruction requires higher resolution than capturing growth, with supersonic regimes being particularly resolution-sensitive.

Abstract: Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism.
