Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\\sim 10 \\times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems."}

Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account."}

However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution."}

We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\\rm cyc}$-$P_{\\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables."}

High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time--frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of ~4--5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

This paper is based on a talk presented at the 87th Fujihara Seminar: The 50th Anniversary Workshop of the Disk Instability Model in Compact Binary Stars, held on 22-26 September 2025 in Tomakomai, Japan. To be published in the Proceedings of Science https://pos.sissa.it/493/", "summary": "WZ Sge-type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae characterised by very rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts. Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions -- such as surface density and effective temperature -- remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$~5$\\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation."}

Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $μ$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $μ$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$α$/H$α$ and Pa$β$/H$α$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions."}

Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars."}

NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\\lesssim M\\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys."}

Invited and accepted by Universe", "summary": "We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations."}

Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\\circ$ ($\\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\\pm0.17~{\\rm dex}~{\\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\\sim 0.8^\\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with \"cored\" and \"cuspy\" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling."}

We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr."}

However, such simulations impose extreme computational requirements that often exceed the capabilities of conventional CPU-based codes. GPU-accelerated simulations offer a transformative solution to mitigate these limitations. In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately. Leveraging GPU-PLUTO's capabilities, we finally present an application by performing high-resolution simulations of giant radio galaxy jets (GRGs $\\gtrsim 1$ Mpc), representing the first such well-resolved 3D study to our knowledge (resolving scales down to 500 pc). These simulations probe a range of environmental effects on GRG jets, clarifying their formation from central galaxies within host cosmic structures, rapid peripheral expansion, and the development of asymmetric cocoon morphologies."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars."}
