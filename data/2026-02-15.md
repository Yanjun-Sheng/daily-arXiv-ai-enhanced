TL;DR: LSBGs have more satellites with higher velocity dispersion than HSBGs, with satellite systems dominated by rotation and counter-rotating relative to the primary disc, suggesting fewer major mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the formation mechanisms of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) in a ΛCDM cosmology by analyzing their properties and satellite systems compared to high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs).

Method: Using the Illustris TNG-100 simulation to analyze central LSBGs and their satellite systems, examining halo properties (spin, concentration), satellite spatial/kinematical distribution, number of satellites, velocity dispersion, and orbital characteristics.

Result: LSBGs have larger satellite numbers and higher velocity dispersion than HSBGs; continuous relation between satellite count and surface brightness; satellite systems in LSBGs are rotation-dominated and counter-rotate relative to primary disc; strong correlation between LSBG existence and rotational satellite systems at fixed stellar mass.

Conclusion: LSBGs likely form through quiescent evolution with fewer major mergers, as evidenced by their rotation-dominated, counter-rotating satellite systems, contrasting with HSBGs that experience more merger-driven radial orbits.

Abstract: We analyse different properties of central low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) and their satellite systems using the simulation Illustris TNG-100, in order to deepen our understanding of the formation mechanism of LSBGs in a $Λ$CDM cosmology. We find differences in the spin and the concentrations of the LSBGs haloes and the host haloes of high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs), consistent with previous studies. By analysing their spatial and kinematical distribution of satellites, we find that LSBGs tend to have a larger number of satellites than HSBGs and with a larger velocity dispersion. Moreover, we obtain a continuous relation between the number of satellites and surface brightness, particularly for massive central galaxies. We also find a relation between surface brightness and the relative tangential velocity of the satellites. For a given stellar mass, the existence of LSBGs is strongly correlated with their satellite system dominated by rotation. Furthermore, the satellite system is systematically in counter-rotation with respect to the primary disc in LSBGs. We propose that this fact reflects that these galaxies have not experienced a significantly high rate of mergers, which are more likely associated with radial orbits expected in systems of galaxies with a high surface brightness.

### [2] [BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11261)

TL;DR: SN feedback in compact star-forming galaxies may facilitate ionizing photon escape during reionization, with SN-hosting galaxies showing elevated SFRs, burstier histories, and bluer UV slopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how supernova feedback shapes properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and facilitates escape of ionizing photons during cosmic reionization.

Method: Cross-matched 1242 Blueberry galaxies with transient discovery reports, identified 11 SNe (10 likely core-collapse), compared SN hosts to larger BB population, estimated SN occurrence rates, and analyzed UV slopes and ionizing photon production efficiency.

Result: SN-hosting BBs show elevated SFRs, burstier star formation histories within last ~50 Myr, higher stellar masses, bluer UV slopes (2.1σ significance), and lower ionizing photon production efficiency (7.9σ significance). SN rate may be slightly suppressed compared to field galaxies.

Conclusion: SN-driven feedback may facilitate ionizing photon escape (supported by bluer UV slopes) but also potentially quenches ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during reionization.

Abstract: While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$σ$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$σ$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.

### [3] [Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268)
*David Benisty,Noam Libeskind,Dmitry Makarov*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Centaurus A and M83 are shown to be gravitationally bound and infalling toward each other, forming a massive binary galaxy system analogous to the Milky Way-Andromeda pair, with a total mass of ~6.36×10¹² M☉.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite observed heliocentric velocities not clearly indicating mutual attraction, the authors investigate whether CenA and M83 form a gravitationally bound binary system similar to the Milky Way-Andromeda pair in the Local Group.

Method: Used the Timing Argument (TA) calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, assuming line-of-sight velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter to estimate total mass.

Result: Estimated total mass of CenA/M83 system is (6.36 ± 1.30) × 10¹² M☉, consistent with independent virial mass measurements and K-band luminosity-to-mass ratios, confirming bound nature.

Conclusion: CenA and M83 form a gravitationally bound binary system analogous to the Local Group, with NGC 4945 potentially playing a perturbing role similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Abstract: Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.

### [4] [The Curious Case of Centaurus A II: On the Subject of the Quenched satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11270)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The Centaurus A satellite system shows a deficit of bright inner-halo satellites, which appears linked to AGN feedback from the host galaxy's radio lobes rather than statistical variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the puzzling deficit of luminous satellite galaxies in the inner regions (d<150 kpc) of Centaurus A, despite the overall satellite population being consistent with theoretical expectations.

Method: Used the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, calibrated to the Milky Way, to investigate potential quenching mechanisms including tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion from the intergalactic medium.

Result: Fiducial models reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict bright inner-halo satellites (Mv < -15.8) by factor of 4±1. The spatial coincidence with Cen A's massive radio lobes suggests AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function.

Conclusion: The "Curious Case of Centaurus A" provides evidence that AGN feedback within the host galaxy regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites, explaining the deficit of bright inner-halo satellites through environmental quenching mechanisms.

Abstract: The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d<150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the "Curious Case of Centaurus A" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.

### [5] [ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW filament I. Enhanced power from excess microwave emission at high spatial frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11356)
*Simon Casassus,Matias Vidal,Miguel Carcamo,Laurent Verstraete,Nathalie Ysard,Emilie Habart*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW PDR reveal a power-law spectrum for anomalous microwave emission with spectral index α=-0.78±0.05, showing increased radio power at small scales relative to IR emission and revealing a compact radio-only source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the anomalous microwave emission (AME) in the rhoOphW PDR through deep, high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy to reveal detailed morphology, search for spectral fine structure, and constrain the high-frequency spectral index drop observed around 30GHz.

Method: Used ALMA Band1 (36-44GHz) mosaic observations to create deep deconvolved images of the filamentary structure. Employed cross-correlation in the uv-plane to extract spectra using the Band1 image as template. Conducted simulations and cross-correlations with near-infrared ancillary data (IRAC 3.6μm) to estimate flux-loss and biases.

Result: The AME spectrum follows a power law with spectral index α=-0.78±0.05, showing no detectable fine structure. Band1 power increases relative to IR emission at high spatial frequencies (2× more power at ~20″ than at ~100″ relative to IRAC 3.6μm). Discovered a compact radio-only source without IR counterpart embedded in filamentary Band1 signal, while IR maps remain smooth in the same region.

Conclusion: The rhoOphW AME exhibits a smooth power-law spectrum consistent with spinning dust emission, with enhanced small-scale radio structure relative to IR emission, suggesting complex spatial variations in the emission mechanism or grain properties. The radio-only source indicates regions where AME dominates without corresponding IR signatures.

Abstract: The rhoOphW photo-dissociation region (PDR) is an example source of bright excess microwave emission (EME), over synchrotron, free-free, and the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) dust continuum. Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling.

### [6] [Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273)
*Sofia L. Splawska,Raphaël Errani,Jorge Peñarrubia,Matthew G. Walker*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Dwarf spheroidal galaxy mass estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about stellar density profiles, with systematic errors up to 10x when using standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard dynamical mass estimators for dwarf spheroidal galaxies rely on assumptions about stellar density profiles, but these assumptions may introduce significant systematic errors that need quantification.

Method: Fit flexible stellar density models to Milky Way dSph observations, use virial theorem to propagate uncertainties in density profile shapes to dynamical mass estimates, and compare various density profile shapes and dark matter halo extents.

Result: The structural diversity of Milky Way dSphs implies potential systematic errors up to factors of 10 in standard dynamical mass estimators, significantly altering the appearance of dSph scaling relations.

Conclusion: Accounting for observational uncertainties in stellar density profiles is crucial for accurate dynamical mass estimation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, as standard methods can produce substantial systematic errors that affect scaling relations.

Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.

TL;DR: Discovery of 323 superfine dusty fibrils (width ~0.01 pc) in 121 massive star-forming clumps across the Galaxy using ALMA-QUARKS survey data, revealing significantly denser structures than previously known filaments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate filamentary structures at finer scales in massive star-forming regions across different Galactic environments, building upon previous studies of larger filaments in nearby clouds.

Method: Used ALMA-QUARKS survey 1.3 mm continuum emission data with ~900 AU resolution at ~3 kpc distance. Identified fibrils using FilFinder software and measured their properties using RadFil software.

Result: Discovered 323 superfine fibrils with typical width ~0.01 pc (10× narrower than Herschel filaments). Mass-length relation follows M ∝ L². Fibrils are significantly denser (N_H₂ = 10²³-10²⁴ cm⁻²) than Herschel filaments (N_H₂ = 10²⁰-10²³ cm⁻²).

Conclusion: This work provides a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, demonstrating the hierarchical nature of filamentary structures in star formation across various physical scales.

Abstract: We report the discovery of more than 323 superfine dusty filamentary structures (fibrils) inside 121 massive star forming clumps that are located in widely different Galactic environments (Galactocentric distances of $\sim$0.5-12.7 kpc). These fibrils are identified from the 1.3~mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\sim900$ AU for a source at $\sim$3 kpc, using the \textit{FilFinder} software. Using \textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \textit{APEX}) surveys. However, these fibrils are significantly denser ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{23}-10^{24}\ cm^{-2}}$) than the filaments found in previous \textit{Herschel} surveys ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{20}-10^{23}\ cm^{-2}}$). This work contributes a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, following the identification of large 0.1-pc wide filaments and associated internal velocity coherent fibers in nearby molecular clouds, further emphasizing the crucial role played by filamentary structures in star formation at various physical scales.

### [8] [First statistical constraints on galactic scale outflows properties traced by their extended Mg II emission with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11280)
*Ismael Pessa,Lutz Wisotzki,Tanya Urrutia,Nicolas F. Bouché,Floriane Leclercq,Ramona Augustin,Yucheng Guo,Daria Kozlova,Haruka Kusakabe,John Pharo*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: First statistical study of MgII-emitting halos around 47 star-forming galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0 using MUSE data, revealing extended emission out to tens of kpc and properties of circumgalactic outflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies of MgII halos tracing galaxy-scale outflows were limited to single-object analyses due to their faintness, creating a need for statistical population-level insights into circumgalactic outflows.

Method: Used deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0, extending previous outflow modeling framework (radially accelerating shells) to larger sample for statistical analysis of MgII emission properties.

Result: Detected extended MgII emission out to tens of kpc; outflows accelerate linearly with radius from ~60 km/s to ~490 km/s (correlated with stellar mass); inner regions highly opaque; opening angle depends on stellar mass; halo sizes peak at ~5 kpc HLR with tail to ~20 kpc; compact halos (<8 kpc) correlate with stellar mass while extended halos do not.

Conclusion: This first statistical study reveals systematic properties of MgII-emitting halos, showing they trace star-formation-driven winds with acceleration patterns, opacity characteristics, and size distributions that vary with galaxy properties, suggesting different powering mechanisms for compact vs. extended halos.

Abstract: Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that astrochemical models developed for interstellar medium studies can be adapted to simulate laboratory astrophysics experiments on CO hydrogenation to methanol, achieving fair agreement despite some discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between astrochemical models and laboratory experiments by testing whether rate-equation models developed for interstellar medium studies can be directly compared with laboratory astrophysics experiments on molecular formation processes.

Method: Conducted 9 laboratory experiments on low-temperature hydrogenation of CO with varying temperature and dose parameters. Used three astrochemical codes (NAUTILUS, pyRate, and MONACO) to simulate experimental conditions, carefully adapting vocabulary and scales for fluxes and time scales.

Result: Demonstrated that different astrochemical codes can be used to compare modeling results directly with experimental outputs. Achieved fair agreement between models and experiments, though discrepancies exist both between models and between models and experiments.

Conclusion: It is possible to use astrochemical models to simulate laboratory experiments, but discrepancies highlight potential issues in chemical networks or physical process descriptions that require further investigation.

Abstract: The development of molecular complexity during stellar and planetary formation owes much to the interaction of gas and dust. When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited. Since then, many groups have developed specific experimental setups to address this issue, but astrochemical models have rarely been directly confronted with these new results. We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes.

### [10] [Evidence for Shallow Nebular Attenuation Curves and Patchy Dust Geometry at z~2 with Pa-beta/H-alpha Measurements from JWST-MegaScience Medium Band Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11418)

TL;DR: JWST medium-band photometry reveals shallow nebular attenuation curve in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating patchy dust geometry especially in massive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1.2-2.4) using JWST medium-band emission line measurements.

Method: Used JWST/MegaScience/UNCOVER medium-band photometry to measure Hα fluxes for 209 galaxies and Paβ fluxes for 66 galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4. Compared Paβ/Hα and Hα/Hβ line ratios with MOSDEF spectroscopic sample to constrain attenuation curves and dust properties.

Result: Paβ/Hα ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and SFR, indicating more massive galaxies are dustier. Shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve fits observations better than Cardelli et al. (1989) curve, especially for massive galaxies. No trend between A_Hα,neb and axis ratio suggests localized, clumpy dust. Shallower attenuation curve increases inferred A_Hα,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses.

Conclusion: Dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon is patchy and non-uniform, particularly in massive galaxies. JWST medium bands enable statistical constraints on dust properties for large galaxy samples, revealing shallow attenuation curves consistent with low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions.

Abstract: We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85<\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)<11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.

TL;DR: AGN feedback in low-redshift quenching galaxies is subtle, with PSBs showing no significant AGN enhancement compared to SFGs and QGs, suggesting preventive rather than ejective feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of AGN feedback in galaxy quenching by examining AGN activity across different galaxy evolutionary stages (post-starburst, star-forming, and quiescent galaxies) at low redshift, addressing the paradox of weak AGN in nearby quenching galaxies.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis using eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio) data for galaxies at z<0.2. Applied AGN incidence assessment and stacking techniques to recover average AGN properties from undetected galaxies. Compared observed luminosity to star formation-derived luminosity (L_obs/L_SF).

Result: PSBs show radio and X-ray emission consistent with star formation dominance. While PSBs have twice the MIR AGN incidence rate of SFGs, their AGN luminosities are small compared to literature MIR AGN. PSBs overall display no significant AGN enhancement relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs.

Conclusion: AGN's role in low-redshift quenching is subtle, likely more "preventive" than "ejective." Obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs, if present, may be fueled by residual gas from preceding starbursts but do not play a dominant quenching role.

Abstract: The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective".

TL;DR: HST F225W observations of Abell 2744 enable measurement of UV luminosity function at z~0.55 down to extremely faint luminosities (M_UV < -13.5), revealing faint-end slope α = -1.324 and ruling out turn-over brighter than M_UV = -15.5 at 3σ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Hubble Frontier Fields observations to F225W band to probe low-luminosity galaxy regime at intermediate redshifts (0.4 < z < 0.7), leveraging gravitational lensing magnification to study faint-end behavior of UV luminosity function.

Method: HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations of Abell 2744 field, combining deep Near-UV imaging with strong gravitational lensing magnification. Hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection identifies 152 faint galaxies. Maximum likelihood estimation with Schechter function parameterization including curvature parameter δ to account for possible faint-end turn-over.

Conclusion: First paper in series demonstrates successful extension of HFF observations to F225W band, enabling unprecedented constraints on faint-end UV luminosity function at intermediate redshifts using gravitational lensing magnification.

Abstract: By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog. Using a sample defined by a $50\%$ completeness cut and applying the maximum likelihood estimation, we derive the best-fit Schechter parameters for the UV LF at $z \sim 0.55$ down to $M_\text{UV} < -13.5$ mag, including a faint-end slope of $α= -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$. We incorporate a curvature parameter $δ$ in parameter estimation to account for a possible turn-over at the faint end of the UV LF, leveraging the exceedingly low luminosities probed by our sample. Our results rule out a turn-over brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at the $3σ$ confidence level.

TL;DR: JWST observations of z>9 galaxies reveal highly efficient star formation with rapid gas depletion timescales, explaining their UV-brightness through efficient star formation and low dust obscuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the apparent overabundance of UV-bright galaxies at z≳9 and constrain the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen onto galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionization.

Method: Analyzed JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectroscopic observations of galaxies confirmed at z>9, modeling their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission, particularly damped Lyman-α absorption features to derive HI column densities and star-formation rate surface densities.

Result: All galaxies show highly efficient star formation with rapid ~10-100 Myr depletion timescales, greatly exceeding the local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and simulation predictions. Dense HI gas drives offsets from the fundamental-metallicity relation, while dust-to-gas ratios are consistent with local galaxies except for lowest metallicity sight-lines.

Conclusion: Provides first robust observational constraints on pristine HI gas impact on early galaxy assembly, suggesting that highly efficient star formation combined with low dust obscuration likely explains the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.

Abstract: One of the major conundrums in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics is the apparent overabundance of a remarkable population of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 9$. We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z>9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$α$ (Ly$α$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\sim 10-100\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.

*F. Stefani,G. M. Horstmann,G. Mamatsashvili,T. Weier*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes planetary tidal influences on solar activity, finding that the 1.723-year quasi-biennial oscillation period matches the beat frequency of Venus-Earth-Jupiter spring tides, and shows alignment of recent solar events with tidal maxima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between planetary tidal forces and solar activity patterns, particularly the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and its relationship to planetary spring tides, and to test whether recent solar events align with tidal forcing maxima.

Method: Analysis of 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares to determine the dominant period of solar QBO, comparison with planetary tidal periods, and examination of alignment between solar events (2024 May 10 solar storm, 2026 February 1 X-flare, 1959 Carrington event) and tidal forcing maxima.

Result: The dominant QBO period is found to be approximately 1.723 years, which matches the beat frequency between the spring tide periods of Venus, Earth, and Jupiter. Recent solar events (2024 storm, 2026 X-flare) align well with tidal forcing maxima, while the 1859 Carrington event does not fit this pattern.

Conclusion: Planetary tidal forces, particularly from Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, appear to synchronize solar activity patterns including the quasi-biennial oscillation, with recent solar events showing alignment with tidal maxima, though not all historical events follow this pattern.

Abstract: Magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline are currently considered to be one of the main determinants of solar activity. In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing. By contrast, the Carrington event (1959 September 1) does not fit this pattern.

TL;DR: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that turbulence and magnetic fields from the smoldering phase enhance mixing between burned/unburned material, solving the insufficient white dwarf expansion problem in delayed detonation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address a fundamental inconsistency in 3D delayed detonation models: insufficient white dwarf expansion during deflagration phase compared to spherical models, which fails to produce partially burned layers characteristic of Type Ia supernovae.

Method: Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using FLASH code, comparing hydrodynamical simulations with those including preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields on scales expected from the smoldering phase.

Result: Turbulence and magnetic fields promote entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, enabling conductive ignition of surrounding fuel. This enhances effective burning to approach spherical model levels, addressing the inefficient burning problem in 3D hydrodynamical simulations.

Conclusion: The dominant mechanism is enhanced mixing between burned/unburned material rather than changes in small-scale flame physics. This solution works best when turbulent length scales are smaller than unburned plume scales, resolving a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models.

Abstract: We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.

TL;DR: Simulating solar flares with inverse FIP effect coronal composition shows coronal rain formation is harder on M-dwarfs when corona is depleted of low FIP elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve radiative hydrodynamic simulation accuracy by dynamically modeling spatio-temporal elemental abundance variations, and to explore extreme non-solar coronal compositions like the inverse FIP effect observed on M-dwarf stars.

Method: Using hydrodynamic flare models with field-aligned geometry, starting with an initial corona dominated by inverse FIP effect (high FIP element enrichment), simulating flaring events, and comparing with solar case simulations that start with normal FIP effect.

Result: Flaring events in coronae enriched with high FIP elements produce solutions similar to solar cases, but coronal rain formation is more difficult during flares on M-dwarfs when the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.

Conclusion: The inverse FIP effect composition in M-dwarf coronae affects coronal condensation formation during flares, making rain harder to form compared to solar-like FIP effect conditions, highlighting the importance of initial coronal composition in flare dynamics.

Abstract: Solar atmospheric elemental abundances are now known to vary both in space and time. Dynamic modeling of these changes is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy of radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Recent studies have shown that including spatio-temporal variations in coronal abundances during solar flares leads to the formation of coronal condensations (rain), which are otherwise difficult to create in impulsively heated field aligned hydrodynamic flare models. These simulations start with a solar corona dominated by the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, and evaporate photospheric material into the post-flare loops. We here explore perhaps the most extreme non-solar starting condition for the coronal composition in these simulations: an initial corona dominated by the inverse FIP (iFIP) effect, such as is observed on active M-dwarf stars. We show that a flaring event in a corona enriched with high FIP elements leads to a solution similar to the solar case. Coronal rain is harder to form by this method during flares on M-dwarfs, however, if the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.

Motivation: CSST requires stable celestial benchmark fields for rigorous on-orbit calibration to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout its decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey mission.

Method: Established comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction.

Conclusion: The selected six globular clusters are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey and will serve as stable celestial benchmark fields for the mission's decade-long calibration needs.

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will perform a decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey that relies on rigorous on-orbit calibration. This necessitates stable celestial benchmark fields to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime. We establish comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Using the CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD, we constrain eligible regions to the ranges of ecliptic latitude $ |β| > 50^\circ$ and galactic latitude $|b| > 15^\circ$. From an initial sample of 29 candidate clusters meeting these spatial constraints, six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields, fulfilling all the critical criteria.

*Sihui Zhong,Andrew Hillier,Iñigo Arregui*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Nonlinear damping of coronal loop oscillations via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability-induced turbulence is studied through 3D MHD simulations and forward modeling, revealing observable signatures like time-varying frequencies, mode excitation, and channel-dependent decay rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations in coronal loops are significantly affected by nonlinear processes like Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and turbulence, but comprehensive theory and observational confirmation are still limited.

Method: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations combined with forward-modelled EUV images to investigate observational signatures of nonlinear turbulence damping.

Result: Simulations show time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates consistent with nonlinear turbulence theory, excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods, and reduced amplitudes. Synthetic observations preserve these features but require higher spatial resolution for higher-order modes. Hotter EUV channels show faster decay with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than cooler channels. Bayesian fitting reveals robust constraints on initial amplitude and period but degeneracy in damping parameters.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations, though additional observables are needed for reliable seismological inference due to parameter degeneracy in damping profiles.

Abstract: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and turbulence, though comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited. Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.

TL;DR: Derived new period-radius relation and surface brightness-color relations for classical Cepheids using Gaia data, quantifying metallicity effects on SBCRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish accurate surface brightness-color relations (SBCRs) for classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds using Gaia photometric data, and to quantify the metallicity effect on these relations for application in the inverse Baade-Wesselink method.

Method: 1) Applied quality criteria to select best Gaia photometric data and parallaxes for Milky Way Cepheids; 2) Compiled literature period-radius relations and derived new PR relation from interferometric data; 3) Combined Cepheid radii with distance estimates (Gaia parallaxes for MW, eclipsing binaries for Magellanic Clouds) to derive surface brightness and color for ~1700 Cepheids.

Result: 1) New PR relation: log(R/R⊙) = 1.133±0.019 + 0.688±0.016 log(P); 2) Metallicity doesn't affect PR relations; 3) Derived three SBCRs showing metallicity dependence; 4) Established relations between SBCR slopes/zero points and metallicity: Slope = -0.0663±0.0121[Fe/H] - 0.3010±0.0030, ZP = -0.1016±0.0091[Fe/H] + 3.9988±0.0029.

Conclusion: New SBCRs for classical Cepheids in Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds are crucial for applying the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to Gaia-observed Cepheids in future studies, with quantified metallicity effects enabling more accurate distance determinations.

Abstract: Aims: We derive SBCRs for classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds using the photometric data available in the Gaia database, and we quantify the metallicity effect. Methods: We first selected the data on the basis of a number of quality criteria and chose the best photometric data and the best parallaxes available in Gaia for Milky Way classical Cepheids. Secondly, we compiled an extensive list of period-radius (PR) relations available in the literature, and we also provide a new PR relation based on interferometric data in our previous work. Thirdly, combining the radius of classical Cepheids with distance estimates (based on Gaia parallaxes for the Milky Way and on eclipsing binaries for the Magellanic Clouds), we derived the surface brightness and colour of about 1700 classical Cepheids. Results: We first derived a new PR relation based on interferometric data and distances from the literature of seven classical Cepheids: $\mathrm{\log(R/R_{\odot}) = 1.133_{\pm 0.019} + 0.688_{\pm 0.016} log(P)}$. The metallicity does not affect the PR relations. Secondly, we calculated three different SBCRs for the Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud classical Cepheids based on this new PR relation that clearly show the dependence of the metallicity on the SBCR based on Gaia magnitudes alone. Finally, we derived relations between the slopes, the zero points (ZP), and the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of these three SBCRs: $\mathrm{Slope_{SBCR}=-0.0663_{\pm 0.0121} [Fe/H] - 0.3010_{\pm 0.0030}}$ and $\mathrm{ZP_{SBCR}=-0.1016_{\pm 0.0091} [Fe/H] + 3.9988_{\pm 0.0029}}$. Conclusions: These new SBCRs, dedicated to classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, are of particular importance to apply the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to classical Cepheids observed by Gaia in a forthcoming study.

TL;DR: B335 protostar outburst study reveals outflow cavity carved by jet, with shock fronts showing varying emission features and kinematic ages corresponding to outburst phases, plus complex ice and gas absorption patterns near the protostar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effects of an ongoing major outburst in the B335 protostar on its jet and outflow cavity, using the rare opportunity provided by this active event to understand protostellar outburst dynamics and their impact on surrounding material.

Method: Used photometry of background stars to map visual continuum extinction and H₂O ice absorption, measured precise proper motions of shock fronts, analyzed emission features (CO, H₂, [Fe II]), and examined absorption spectra (¹³CO₂, OCN⁻, OCS) in the outflow cavity.

Result: The outflow has carved a cavity; shock front 3E's kinematic age matches early outburst phases and shows strong CO emission; older shocks have diminished CO but maintain H₂ and [Fe II]; feature 0E differs in motion/velocity; extinction increases dramatically near protostar (A_V ≈ 200 mag); ice absorption features intensify toward protostar; CO shows both emission and absorption patterns.

Conclusion: The B335 outburst has significantly shaped its outflow cavity and jet, with shock fronts tracing outburst history through varying emission properties, while complex ice and gas absorption patterns near the protostar reveal the dense, evolving environment of this active protostellar system.

Abstract: The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.
