Abstract: We demonstrate proof-of-concept of a new strategy for studying infrared (IR) transients enabled by the newly launched SPHEREx space mission, by leveraging its synergy with the NEOWISE space mission. With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).

Abstract: Sunspots are obvious observable manifestations of the toroidal magnetic field generated through the dynamo in the convection zone. They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.

Abstract: We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We report the discovery of a lithium dip (Li-dip) in the stellar "Snake" (age = $35 \pm 5$ Myr), challenging the classical view that Li-dips emerge only at ages $\gtrsim 150$ Myr. Using high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 ($R \sim 28,000$) for 211 member stars, we identify a clear depletion feature in a $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ range of 6200--6800 K with a depth of $ΔA(\mathrm{Li}) \approx 0.40$ dex. Our analysis reveals two key advances: the Li-dip appears $\gtrsim 100$ Myr earlier than the previous observations, and within the dip temperature range, a significant correlation is found between rotational velocity and lithium depletion. Specifically, fast rotators ($v \sin i > 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \sin i < 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction. It is also found that the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for the young open clusters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.

Abstract: Modern tools for modeling stellar evolution, such as MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), offer state-of-the-art implementations of stellar theories. However, this parametric approach introduces many free parameters that are often not constrained by observations. This is particularly important for evolved stars, like classical Cepheids, because uncertainties increase with evolution time. In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg.
  We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses between 2 to 8 solar mass and metallicities Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014 are explored, spanning the range of classical Cepheids. Both canonical and overshooting models are computed and compared.
  We find that uncertainties in surface abundances are generally small, arising mainly from variations in the depth of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning. Surface and central abundances for the considered models at several benchmark points during the evolution are provided online.

Abstract: The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.

Abstract: The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics.

Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).

Abstract: We present a new method for estimating the total energy radiated by stellar flares in broad-band continua, which assumes a constant emitting area but incorporates a time-dependent temperature evolution. This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000\,K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000\,K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates. We proved this on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares.

Abstract: Given the wealth of data provided by Gaia and the upcoming PLATO mission, it is essential to improve stellar models to obtain accurate stellar ages. Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($α_A $ and $α_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $α$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies.

Abstract: Binaries in the cores of globular clusters are known to prevent the gravitational collapse of the cluster, and simulations predict that the core of NGC 6397 contains a large number of white dwarfs (WDs), of which many are expected to be part of a binary system. In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.

Abstract: Granulation is the observable signature of convection in envelopes of low-mass stars, forming the background in stellar power spectra. While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $ν_\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $ν_\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs. Finally, we contribute a dataset linking granulation, oscillations, and stellar parameters, providing a foundation for future investigations into their interdependence across the HR diagram.

Abstract: The Solar Hemispherical Helicity Rule(s) (SHHR) is a term used to represent a bias observed in proxies for the magnetic helicity in active regions at the solar surface. The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $Σ$-effect model of \cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $Σ$-effect in reality.

Abstract: We have used data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) to perform a helioseismic diagnosis of changes to the Sun's internal structure between four successive solar cycle minima, beginning with the minimum at the end of cycle 21 and ending with the recent minimum at the beginning of cycle 25. The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\approx 0.9 R_{\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed. Our results demonstrate the potential of using asteroseismic data to perform similar analyses on other solar-type stars.

Abstract: The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in cosmology, the Hubble Tension, requires independent measurements of $H_0$, and strong lensing with time-delay cosmography is a promising avenue. The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \pm 1.6\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \pm 1.9\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \pm 1.6\%$ (gOM), with $\sim 5\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \pm 1.3\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.

Abstract: We build a catalog of massive (M>$8~$M$_\odot$) main sequence stars in the \mbox{metal-poor} ($\sim0.1~$Z$_\odot$) dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A. HST WFC3 UV photometry in the 275 and 336 nm wideband filters is arranged in a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD), and overlaid on top of stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST library. The star properties (mass, age, etc.) are computed with a Finite Element (FE) interpolation of the stellar tracks. The FE method, originally developed for solid mechanics problems, provides a general framework for interpolating fields inside domains of complex geometry. Besides the interpolated properties, the algorithm computes their gradients with respect to the photometry. These sensitivities provide a direct an efficient estimate of the associated uncertainties. Our catalog contains 655 stars, with the most massive one estimated at $58\pm11~$M$_\odot$. A comparison with a ground-based spectroscopic census of OB stars yields only 8 matches, evidencing the minimal overlap between both datasets. The mass estimates derived from the UV CMD and the spectral classification are in good agreement for the majority of O-type stars found in both datasets. Our catalog provides an extensive list of candidates for followup spectroscopic observation, which could improve our understanding of the early evolutionary stages of massive \mbox{low-metallicity} stars.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies ($9.0 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10.0$) at cosmic noon using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that can reproduce the multiphase outflows in M82. The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Outflow properties vary strongly with time, radial distance to galaxy center, stellar mass, and gas fraction, exhibiting velocities of 50-1000 $\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factors, $η_\mathrm{M}$, of 0.24-6.26. The cool phase ($8000 < T \le 2 \times 10^4$ K) dominates the outflow, and properties of the cool and warm phases are broadly consistent with observations. At $M_*= 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, average $η_\mathrm{M}$ for the total, cool, and warm phases are $\sim$1.2, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. The mass loading factor decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass, but increases with star formation rate. Given strong temporal and spatial evolution, scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated with caution. Our total $η_\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.

Abstract: Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures serve as evidence of the intricate mass assembly of galaxies, and dedicatedly studying them promises to give us profound insights into the evolutionary history of galaxies. Furthermore, delving into the properties of star formation (SF) in the LSB regime can broaden our understanding of SF activity in regions characterized by low surface gas density, thereby shedding light on fundamental cosmic processes. However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies. To further advance the capabilities of the K-DRIFT survey, focused on LSB detection, we present several feasible research topics that utilize other survey data together and discuss the role of LSB observation in understanding the evolution of galaxies.

Abstract: We present the Two Deep Fields Imaging Survey (2DFIS), a wide-field imaging program conducted with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) targeting two astrophysically distinct regions: one containing a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source and another hosting a candidate of a rotating galaxy cluster. Achieving a depth of r~26mag, the survey enables a search for faint optical counterparts and environmental signatures associated with the FRB, while high-quality photometric and galaxy shape measurements in the cluster field support a weak-lensing analysis of its mass distribution. This paper describes the observing strategy and data processing methodology adopted for 2DFIS, including the use of the LSST Science Pipelines with survey-specific adaptations for CFHT/MegaCam data. We outline a complete workflow for transforming raw CFHT exposures into science-ready data products, including calibrated single-epoch images, multi-band coadded mosaics, and extensive source catalogs. These data products provide the foundation for ongoing and future studies of FRB host environments, cluster mass reconstruction, and related cosmological applications.

Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster RXCJ0110.0+1358 ($z=0.058$), a rotating cluster candidate, combining deep CFHT imaging, SDSS photometry, spectroscopic redshifts, and XMM-Newton X-ray observations. We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\log M_{200}/M_\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_\odot$). This immense mass disparity rules out the dynamical possibility of a rotating system. We demonstrate that the apparent optical bimodality arises from the projection of a filament, which led optical group-finding algorithms to misclassify these galaxies as cluster members. This contamination creates a spurious substructure that mimics a rotation signal and leads to an overestimation of the luminosity-based halo mass, resolving the observed inconsistencies.

Abstract: We present the third data release for the Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, covering = 3800 deg2 of the southern Galactic Plane (GP) with \ang{233} < l < \ang{44} and |b| < \ang{11} across a frequency range of 72 - 231 MHz divided into 20 sub-bands. GLEAM-X observations were taken using the "extended" Phase-II configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which features baselines ranging from approximately 12 m to 5 km. This configuration limits sensitivity to the diffuse structure of the GP, with an angular resolution range of about 45'' to 2'. To achieve lower noise levels while being sensitive to a wide range of spatial scales (45''- \ang{15}), we combined these observations with the previous Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. For the area covered, we provide images spanning the whole frequency range. A wide-band image over 170 - 231 MHz, with RMS noise of = 3 - 6 mJy/beam and source position accuracy within 1 arcseconds, is then used to perform source-finding, which yields 98,207 elements measured across 20 x 7.68 MHz frequency bands. The catalogue is 90% complete at 50 mJy within \ang{233} < l < \ang{324} and at 125 mJy in \ang{290} < l < \ang{44}, while it is 99.3% reliable overall. All the images and the catalogue are available online for download.

Abstract: Two mysterious unresolved HI structures at velocities of +12 and -6 km/s were discovered in high resolution 21-cm survey data in the direction of a faint white dwarf star. Examination of the HI morphology in this area of sky shows that the star and HI features exists in a large cavity in interstellar HI surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association. The cavity may have been created by an ancient supernova. It is hypothesized that the pair of HI features and filamentary HI structure found in its immediate vicinity may be the remnants of a planetary nebula some 3 x 10^5 years old that have cooled to the point that the gas is neutral and emitting the 21-cm spectral line. This remnant has maintained the morphological characteristics of the original planetary nebula because it expanded into a volume of space relatively devoid of interstellar gas that would otherwise have absorbed any traces of the original nebula.
