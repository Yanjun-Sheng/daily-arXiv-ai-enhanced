The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$\u03b1$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$\u03b1$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$\u03b1$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions.

It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data.

Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates.

Comparing resolved radio and H$\u03b1$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$\u03b1$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$\u03b1$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks. These results demonstrate that ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails.", "AI": {"tldr": "WEAVE IFU observations of 5 jellyfish galaxies in Coma cluster reveal that tail emission is dominated by ram-pressure-driven shocks rather than star formation, with LINER-like diagnostics and enhanced line ratios/velocities.", "motivation": "Jellyfish galaxies represent extreme cases of ram pressure stripping (RPS) effects, but the nature of ionized emission in their tails remains unclear - whether from star formation or other processes like shocks.", "method": "Used WEAVE Large-IFU observations of 5 jellyfish galaxies from Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS), comparing emission line properties between disks and tails, analyzing BPT diagnostics, line ratios, and velocity measurements.", "result": "Tail emission is not dominated by star formation; shows LINER-like characteristics with enhanced [OI]/H\u03b1 ratios; elevated [OII]/H\u03b1 ratios in tails; similarly high emission line velocities and dispersions in tails compared to disks.", "conclusion": "Ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails, rather than star formation, as evidenced by shock diagnostics in line ratios and kinematics."}}

We measure disk radii in silhouette against the bright background, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen $\u03b1$ intensities, and derive near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs). From these diagnostics we define a typology of ONC disks. \\textit{Type I} sources show merged IFs and DFs close to the disk surface. \\textit{Type II} sources have DFs at the disk surface and IFs located tens of astronomical units away. \\textit{Type III} sources show a DF at the disk surface but no IF. For all types, PAH emission traces the PDR. We find that the disk radius $r{\\rm disk}$ increases with projected distance to the ionizing source $d{\\rm proj}$, following $r{\\rm disk} \\propto d{\\rm proj}^{0.30}$, consistent with disk truncation by photoevaporation. Disk radii measured in the infrared are larger than those measured at millimeter wavelengths, suggesting radial dust segregation within the disks. In agreement with PDR models, the thermal pressure in the disk PDR increases with the FUV radiation field $G_0$, but with a flatter slope. Finally, the SEDs of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) are similar to those of \\textit{Type III} disks, except for JuMBO24, which resembles a \\textit{Type I} or \\textit{Type II} source. Its SED is consistent with a young low-mass binary hosting an unresolved ionized disk.", "AI": {"tldr": "Analysis of Orion Nebula Cluster disks using NIRCam imaging reveals three disk types based on dissociation/ionization front positions, shows disk radii scaling with distance from ionizing source consistent with photoevaporation truncation, and identifies dust segregation and PDR thermal pressure trends.", "motivation": "To characterize protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster by analyzing their structural properties, radiation environment effects, and evolutionary states using high-resolution near-infrared observations.", "method": "Used high angular resolution NIRCam images from PDRs4All and GTO program 1256 to measure disk radii in silhouette, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen \u03b1 intensities, derive near-infrared SEDs, and establish a disk typology based on DF/IF positions relative to disk surfaces.", "result": "Identified three disk types: Type I (merged IFs/DFs near disk surface), Type II (DFs at surface, IFs tens of AU away), Type III (DFs at surface, no IF).
