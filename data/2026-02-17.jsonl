Revisiting Energy Transfer Mechanisms and Luminosity Behavior", "comment": "Accepted by the PASP journal", "summary": "We presented the first high-precision, detailed photometric analysis of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binaries, Linear 10772300, Linear 11150338, Linear 20372537 and DM Cir. In addition to ground-based multiband photometric observations, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) were employed for the analysis of the DM Cir system. New ephemeris and linear fit to the O-C diagrams were derived using extracted times of minima and additional literature. The light curve modeling was performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the BSN application, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. In each systems, the two stellar components exhibited minimal temperature differences ($ΔT<150$ K), confirming efficient energy exchange within their common convective envelopes. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) parallax and astrophysical equations. Based on effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype systems, while others belonged to the A-subtype. We computed the initial masses of the primary ($M_{1i}$) and secondary ($M_{2i}$) components for four target systems using a method based on the observational properties of overluminous secondary components. We found initial primary masses in the range 0.6-1.0$M_\\odot$ and initial secondary masses in the range 0.9-1.7$M_\\odot$ with mass loss $<1.0M_{\\odot}$. We investigated the relative energy transfer rates ($U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$) and nuclear luminosities ($L_{10}$ and $L_{20}$) based on the physical parameters of 411 W UMa-type contact binaries, including the four systems analyzed in this study, through wide range of mass ratios. The results for all systems provided a comprehensive view of energy transfer behavior throughout different evolutionary stages of contact binaries."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds."}

It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects the kink frequency in curved coronal loops. This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal loops and discuss their seismological potential. We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared with the WKB approximation. For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about 18\\% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7\\% deviation in our current model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation. The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at different locations along a coronal loop."}

Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($λ_{\\rm Edd}=2.7\\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot})=7.55\\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators.

We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_*\\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\\log (M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)\\approx 9$ and $M_*\\approx 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe."}

In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Double white dwarfs (DWDs) are by far the most common compact binaries in the Milky Way, are important low-frequency gravitational-wave sources, and in some cases merge to become Type Ia supernovae. So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright ($r \\lesssim20~$mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P $\\approx$ 10-600 minutes with moderate to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47 are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for DWDs in spectroscopic searches. The formation of unequal mass, short-period DWDs strongly depends on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during the LSST era."}

We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters."}

Additionally, we confirm the earlier findings of the spin and beat periods to be 465.4721 s and 488.6067 s, respectively. The time-resolved timing analysis reveals that V515 And undergoes changes in its accretion geometry, not only between different TESS sectors but also within individual sector observations. The system exhibits a transition in the dominant accretion mode, switching between disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. In the TESS light curve, we identify two successive outburst-like episodes, each persisting for roughly a day and reaching peak luminosities of $2.7\\times10^{33}$ and $1.9\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

Using a mock lightcone built from the Millennium I Simulation plus a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we identified 7709 CGs when applying the standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, we placed 1000 random observers on a surrounding sphere and reapplied the velocity and compactness requirements to test recoverability. We also examined the variation of population and local isolation. The velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity to the observer's location: 10% of CGs fail for some observers, typically groups with members with high peculiar velocities (>1000 km/s). The compactness requirement is far more fragile, as 44% of CGs are missed by most observers, and these systems are very elongated or are chance alignments in real space. Tightening selection limits reduces this dependence. Lowering the surface brightness threshold to $μ\\leq 23 \\ mag/arcsec^2$ reduces the compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing the velocity limit to $ΔV\\leq 250 \\ km/s$ lowers velocity-driven failures to less than 4%. Applying both cuts simultaneously yields up to 84% observer-independent groups, although with a substantially smaller sample. Population and isolation are affected by bright interlopers seen from different directions. While such interlopers are common, they have only a minor effect on the compactness and velocity concordance criteria; however, the local isolation is commonly broken. Observer frame effects, dominated by the compactness criterion, can significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples. However, adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds allows users to balance the physical reliability according to their specific scientific goals."}

Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules.

This complements our previous analysis of a symmetric sample with [Fe/H] < -0.8. We derived individual abundances through spectral synthesis for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce using stellar parameters from APOGEE DR17, and compared the results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. The alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca, and iron-peak elements V, Cr, Co, and Ni follow the expected trends relative to the models. Mn shows secondary behaviour.

To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data.

We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic."}

We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium."}

By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$α$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$α$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($λ_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\\sim 10^5-10^7\\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a \"Clumpy Envelope\" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population."}

However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis."}

We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission.

We analyzed contaminations related to host galaxies, particularly from polar dust, the interstellar medium, and stellar emission that affect the optical and infrared. We used a sample of nearly 400 quasars with photometrical observations and spectroscopical redshift divided into four redshift bins (0.7-2.4). Full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed with the CIGALE code, and results were compared with simplified photometric luminosity estimates. The impact of non-active galactic nucleus components and the role of polar dust in the fitting process were assessed. We show that for sources with a disk luminosity above 10^45 [erg/s], the photometric estimates are consistent with SED-based values. While polar dust contributes marginally to luminosity, its presence significantly alters SED fitting, particularly the torus opening angle and cold dust properties. In the optical domain, stellar emission is the dominant contamination. In the infrared, disk emission and cold dust play major roles. We propose two empirical calibrations for the OPT-IR relation. We conclude that the optical band is dominated by the accretion disk component above 10^45 or 10^46 [erg/s] depending on redshift, while IR luminosity is dominated by the dusty torus emission above 1.6 $\\times$ 10^45 or 2 $\\times$ 10^46 [erg/s] depending on the redshift.

Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$\" resolution ($\\sim0.3\\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends.

The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause."}

Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$."}

So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright ($r \\lesssim20~$mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P $\\approx$ 10-600 minutes with moderate to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47 are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for DWDs in spectroscopic searches. The formation of unequal mass, short-period DWDs strongly depends on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during the LSST era."}
