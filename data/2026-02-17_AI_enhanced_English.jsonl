Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\\star \\sim 10^7 M_\\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \\texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs, $\u03c6_{\\rm WBH}(M_\\star)$, finding that it peaks at $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)=11.10^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe reside in galaxies with $10.7 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.2$, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping.

Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$\" resolution ($\\sim0.3\\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger.

II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry", "comment": "18 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted in ApJ", "summary": "We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates how nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains affects H\u2082 ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and deuterium fractionation in star-forming regions, focusing on how surface interactions modify the rotational energy difference between ortho- and para-H\u2082.", "motivation": "Previous studies assumed the rotational energy difference between ortho-H\u2082 and para-H\u2082 on grain surfaces is the same as in gas phase (170.5 K), but surface interactions likely reduce this difference, affecting NSC rates and thus H\u2082 OPR evolution and deuterium fractionation in cold star-forming regions.", "method": "The authors relax the assumption of constant 170.5 K energy difference and re-evaluate NSC rates with varying rotational energy differences between adsorbed ortho- and para-H\u2082 ground states.
