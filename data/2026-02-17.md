TL;DR: First high-precision photometric analysis of four W UMa-type contact binaries using ground-based and TESS data, revealing efficient energy exchange, initial mass estimates, and comprehensive energy transfer behavior across evolutionary stages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct detailed photometric analysis of W Ursae Majoris-type contact binaries to understand their physical properties, energy exchange mechanisms, and evolutionary characteristics through precise observational data and modeling.

Method: Combined ground-based multiband photometry with TESS data for DM Cir; used PHOEBE Python code and BSN application with MCMC approach for light curve modeling; derived new ephemeris from O-C diagrams; estimated absolute parameters using Gaia DR3 parallax; computed initial masses using overluminous secondary method; analyzed energy transfer rates across 411 systems.

Result: Found minimal temperature differences (ΔT<150 K) confirming efficient energy exchange; classified two systems as W-subtype and two as A-subtype; estimated initial primary masses 0.6-1.0M⊙ and secondary masses 0.9-1.7M⊙ with mass loss <1.0M⊙; provided comprehensive energy transfer behavior across different evolutionary stages.

Conclusion: The study presents the first high-precision analysis of four W UMa contact binaries, demonstrating efficient convective energy exchange, providing initial mass estimates, and offering insights into energy transfer behavior across evolutionary stages of contact binary systems.

Abstract: We presented the first high-precision, detailed photometric analysis of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binaries, Linear 10772300, Linear 11150338, Linear 20372537 and DM Cir. In addition to ground-based multiband photometric observations, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) were employed for the analysis of the DM Cir system. New ephemeris and linear fit to the O-C diagrams were derived using extracted times of minima and additional literature. The light curve modeling was performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the BSN application, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. In each systems, the two stellar components exhibited minimal temperature differences ($ΔT<150$ K), confirming efficient energy exchange within their common convective envelopes. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) parallax and astrophysical equations. Based on effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype systems, while others belonged to the A-subtype. We computed the initial masses of the primary ($M_{1i}$) and secondary ($M_{2i}$) components for four target systems using a method based on the observational properties of overluminous secondary components. We found initial primary masses in the range 0.6-1.0$M_\odot$ and initial secondary masses in the range 0.9-1.7$M_\odot$ with mass loss $<1.0M_{\odot}$. We investigated the relative energy transfer rates ($U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$) and nuclear luminosities ($L_{10}$ and $L_{20}$) based on the physical parameters of 411 W UMa-type contact binaries, including the four systems analyzed in this study, through wide range of mass ratios. The results for all systems provided a comprehensive view of energy transfer behavior throughout different evolutionary stages of contact binaries.

### [2] [The Effect of Gravitational Stratification on Kink Oscillations in Curved Coronal Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12890)
*Mingzhe Guo,Bo Li,Mijie Shi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Gravitational stratification affects kink oscillation frequencies differently for vertical vs. horizontal polarizations in curved coronal loops, with vertical fundamental modes showing 18% deviation from WKB approximation while horizontal fundamentals show only 7% deviation, enabling spatially dependent coronal seismology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how gravitational stratification affects kink oscillation frequencies in curved coronal loops and explore their seismological potential, as it remains unclear how stratification influences these frequencies in curved geometries.

Method: Numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations (vertical and horizontal) and harmonics (fundamental and first overtones) in curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loops, comparing oscillation frequencies derived from Lagrangian displacement with WKB approximation.

Result: Vertically polarized fundamental mode shows ~18% deviation from WKB approximation but closely matches local Alfvén frequency near loop apex. Horizontally polarized fundamental mode shows only ~7% deviation and matches local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. First overtones for both polarizations are well described by WKB approximation.

Conclusion: Vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by local Alfvén frequency near loop apex, while WKB approximation remains reliable for horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, enabling spatially dependent coronal seismology to probe magnetic field strength at different locations along coronal loops.

Abstract: Kink oscillation frequency is a key parameter for coronal seismology. It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects the kink frequency in curved coronal loops. This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal loops and discuss their seismological potential. We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared with the WKB approximation. For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about 18\% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7\% deviation in our current model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation. The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at different locations along a coronal loop.

### [3] [Anomaly Hunter for Alerts (AHA): Anomaly Detection in the ZTF Transient Alert Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12955)
*Leyla Iskandarli,Chris J. Lintott,Steve Croft,Heloise Stevance,Joshua Weston*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline for ZTF alert stream using three autoencoders on object features, images, and light curves to identify exotic transients and anomalous supernovae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of modern time-domain survey alert streams is infeasible at scale, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up observation.

Method: Three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves, trained on predominantly normal transients (SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c).

Result: Consistently recovers exotic transients and anomalous supernovae in both test set and live alert stream; identified 87 unusual supernova candidates over 25 days; minimal overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders.

Conclusion: The framework is data-efficient (requires few thousand training examples) and well-suited for early application to Rubin Observatory alert stream.

Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.

### [4] [Presaging Doppler beaming discoveries of double white dwarfs during the Rubin LSST era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13137)
*Gautham Adamane Pallathadka,Yossef Zenati,Nadia L. Zakamska,Ngan H. Nguyen,Anthony L. Piro*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: LSST can detect at least 287 short-period double white dwarfs via relativistic Doppler beaming, including 47 LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources, enabling new tests of binary evolution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double white dwarfs are abundant compact binaries, important as gravitational wave sources and potential Type Ia supernova progenitors, but none have been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming despite its direct relation to radial velocity.

Method: Comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa code, incorporating results into tripartite Galaxy model, with proof-of-concept simulations to assess LSST's capability to detect Doppler-beamed DWDs.

Result: LSST can reliably recover relatively bright (r ≲20 mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits (P ≈ 10-600 minutes) with moderate to high inclinations, detecting at least 287 short-period DWDs including 47 LISA-detectable sources.

Conclusion: LSST observations of Doppler-beamed DWDs will provide new constraints on binary evolution models, particularly mass-transfer phases, and enable comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary populations into realistic survey simulations.

Abstract: Double white dwarfs (DWDs) are by far the most common compact binaries in the Milky Way, are important low-frequency gravitational-wave sources, and in some cases merge to become Type Ia supernovae. So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright ($r \lesssim20~$mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P $\approx$ 10-600 minutes with moderate to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47 are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for DWDs in spectroscopic searches. The formation of unequal mass, short-period DWDs strongly depends on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during the LSST era.

### [5] [V515 And: An Intermediate Polar in the Period Gap Exhibiting Outbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13153)
*Srinivas M Rao,Jeewan C Pandey,Nikita Rawat,Simone Scaringi,Arti Joshi,David A. H. Buckley,Ajay Kumar Singh*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: V515 And is an intermediate polar cataclysmic variable with orbital period in the period gap, showing accretion geometry changes, micronova-like outbursts, and magnetic characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct comprehensive time-series and spectral analysis of intermediate polar V515 And using TESS and DOT observations to understand its accretion behavior, period characteristics, and outburst properties.

Method: Combined long-term TESS photometric observations with spectroscopic data from 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope for time-series analysis, period determination, and spectral characterization.

Result: Confirmed orbital period of 2.73116 h within period gap, spin period of 465.4721 s, beat period of 488.6067 s; detected accretion geometry changes between disc-fed and stream-fed modes; identified two micronova-like outbursts with peak luminosities ~2.7×10³³ and 1.9×10³³ erg s⁻¹; observed strong Balmer/He II emission with inverse Balmer decrement indicating magnetic nature.

Conclusion: V515 And exhibits dynamic accretion behavior with geometry transitions, micronova-like outbursts, and magnetic characteristics typical of intermediate polars, providing insights into accretion processes in magnetic cataclysmic variables.

Abstract: Using long-term observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) along with spectroscopic observations from the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), we present a comprehensive time-series and spectral analysis of the intermediate polar V515 And. Our analysis reveals that V515 And resides within the period gap, with the detection of its orbital period of 2.73116 h. Additionally, we confirm the earlier findings of the spin and beat periods to be 465.4721 s and 488.6067 s, respectively. The time-resolved timing analysis reveals that V515 And undergoes changes in its accretion geometry, not only between different TESS sectors but also within individual sector observations. The system exhibits a transition in the dominant accretion mode, switching between disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. In the TESS light curve, we identify two successive outburst-like episodes, each persisting for roughly a day and reaching peak luminosities of $2.7\times10^{33}$ and $1.9\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis suggests that these bursts belong to the recently proposed class of micronovae. The optical spectrum of V515 And is characterised by strong Balmer and He II emission lines and shows an inverse Balmer decrement indicating the magnetic nature of the source.

### [6] [What Suppresses Star Formation in Bulge-Dominated Early-Type Galaxies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12324)
*Lori E. Porter,S. M. R. Jeffreson,Greg L. Bryan,Lars Hernquist*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: High-resolution simulations reveal that strong Coriolis forces from elevated galactic shear, driven by high central compactness, can suppress star formation in gas-rich early-type galaxies without requiring gas removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies that have substantial molecular gas reservoirs but low star formation rates.

Method: Five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations using AREPO moving-mesh code, including one Milky Way-like and four early-type galaxies. Applied modified virial theorem to overdensities to quantify forces regulating stability and star formation.

Result: In suppressed galaxies, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear inhibit gravitational collapse, caused by high central compactness. Less compact early-type galaxies have more gravity-dominated clouds and higher SFRs. This gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing classical Toomre-Q parameter.

Conclusion: High central compactness in early-type galaxies can suppress star formation through Coriolis forces from elevated shear, providing a physical mechanism that doesn't require gas removal. Current Toomre-Q parameter may be insufficient, suggesting need for new criterion for suppressed star formation.

Abstract: We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds.

Steinhardt,Francesco Valentino,Fabian Walter,Mengyuan Xiao,Haowen Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: GNz7q is a rapidly growing red quasar at z=7.1899 with super-Eddington accretion and intense star formation, representing a rare phase of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution that can evolve into massive SDSS-like quasars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded in a dusty starburst galaxy at z=7.1899, using comprehensive JWST observations to understand its properties and evolutionary significance in early black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

Method: Used panchromatic optical-mm characterization with full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy revealed broad Balmer emission. Applied accretion-rate corrected black hole mass estimators. Performed joint morphological-spectral analysis after subtracting point source to detect stellar emission from host galaxy.

Result: Confirmed super-Eddington accreting black hole (λ_Edd=2.7±0.4) with mass log(M_BH/M⊙)=7.55±0.34. Host galaxy has stellar mass log(M*/M⊙)=10.5±0.4 and intense SFR=330±97 M⊙ yr⁻¹. GNz7q lies on local M_BH-M* relation (M_BH/M*≈0.001) and can evolve into massive SDSS quasars at z~6. Contrasts with JWST AGN populations like little red dots that lack significant star formation.

Conclusion: GNz7q represents a rare, pivotal phase of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution, providing a direct pathway to supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe, unlike other JWST-detected AGN populations that lack the star formation necessary to grow into massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars.

Abstract: We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($λ_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.

### [8] [A tight relation between the distribution of globular clusters and dark matter in AS1063](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12332)
*J. M. Diego,C. Goolsby,C. J. Conselice,J. M. Palencia*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST observations reveal globular clusters in galaxy cluster AS1063 tightly correlate with dark matter distribution, suggesting they can serve as tracers for mass mapping where lensing data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether globular clusters can serve as reliable tracers of dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, particularly in cases where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters are more easily detectable.

Method: Used deep high-resolution JWST images of galaxy cluster AS1063; carefully masked artifacts, extended features, and background galaxies; identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources (mostly globular clusters) up to 1.18 Mpc from cluster center; compared their spatial distribution with mass distribution from lens model derived from same JWST data; applied smoothing kernel to transform discrete point source distribution into continuous 2D distribution.

Result: Found very tight correlation between globular cluster distribution and dark matter distribution, though globular clusters show more concentrated distribution than dark matter; demonstrated that simple smoothing kernel can transform discrete globular cluster distribution into continuous 2D distribution that matches lensing convergence well.

Conclusion: Globular clusters can be used as effective tracers of dark matter distribution in massive galaxy clusters, especially in low-redshift clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are limited but globular clusters are more easily detectable.

Abstract: Based on deep high resolution JWST images of AS1063, and after a careful masking of artifacts, extended features in the cluster, and background galaxies (including known lensed ones), we have identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources in the central region of the galaxy cluster. We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters.

### [9] [Eye of the beholder: Observer reference frame bias in Hickson-like compact groups of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12358)
*A. Zandivarez,E. Diaz-Gimenez,A. R. Callen*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Hickson-like compact groups (CGs) identification depends strongly on observer's reference frame, with compactness criterion being particularly fragile (44% missed by most observers). Adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds can improve observer-independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how the identification of Hickson-like compact groups depends on the observer's reference frame, examining how frequently the same systems would be recognized from different vantage points and understanding the biases introduced by observer frame effects.

Method: Used mock lightcone from Millennium I Simulation with semi-analytic galaxy formation model, identified 7709 CGs using standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, placed 1000 random observers on surrounding sphere and reapplied velocity and compactness requirements. Examined variation of population and local isolation criteria.

Result: Velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity (10% failure rate), typically for groups with high peculiar velocities. Compactness requirement is far more fragile (44% missed by most observers) due to elongated systems or chance alignments. Tightening selection limits reduces dependence: lowering surface brightness threshold to μ≤23 mag/arcsec² reduces compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing velocity limit to ΔV≤250 km/s lowers velocity failures to <4%. Combined cuts yield up to 84% observer-independent groups but with smaller sample.

Conclusion: Observer frame effects, dominated by compactness criterion, significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples. Adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds allows balancing physical reliability with scientific goals, though stricter cuts reduce sample size.

Abstract: [Abridged] We investigate how the identification of Hickson-like CGs depends on the observer's reference frame, quantifying how frequently the same system would be recognised from different vantage points. Using a mock lightcone built from the Millennium I Simulation plus a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we identified 7709 CGs when applying the standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, we placed 1000 random observers on a surrounding sphere and reapplied the velocity and compactness requirements to test recoverability. We also examined the variation of population and local isolation. The velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity to the observer's location: 10% of CGs fail for some observers, typically groups with members with high peculiar velocities (>1000 km/s). The compactness requirement is far more fragile, as 44% of CGs are missed by most observers, and these systems are very elongated or are chance alignments in real space. Tightening selection limits reduces this dependence. Lowering the surface brightness threshold to $μ\leq 23 \ mag/arcsec^2$ reduces the compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing the velocity limit to $ΔV\leq 250 \ km/s$ lowers velocity-driven failures to less than 4%. Applying both cuts simultaneously yields up to 84% observer-independent groups, although with a substantially smaller sample. Population and isolation are affected by bright interlopers seen from different directions. While such interlopers are common, they have only a minor effect on the compactness and velocity concordance criteria; however, the local isolation is commonly broken. Observer frame effects, dominated by the compactness criterion, can significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples. However, adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds allows users to balance the physical reliability according to their specific scientific goals.

### [10] [Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Diagnostics for Interstellar PAHs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12531)
*Zhao Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Machine learning framework using Random Forest classifier analyzes complete 2.75-20 micron PAH emission spectra to overcome limitations of traditional empirical band ratios, achieving high classification accuracy across size/charge categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAH diagnostics using empirical band ratios suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias, limiting accurate characterization of interstellar medium conditions.

Method: Developed a machine learning framework treating complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as high-dimensional fingerprint, trained Random Forest classifier on 23,653 spectra dataset for classification across 12 size and charge categories.

Result: Achieved robust classification F1-score of ~0.96 across categories, maintained high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules, revealed PAH size diagnostics are charge-dependent with different spectral features tracing neutral vs ionized species.

Conclusion: The approach provides robust, data-driven pathway for decoding interstellar medium physical conditions, revealing charge-dependent nature of PAH size diagnostics and identifying specific spectral features for different charge states.

Abstract: Traditional interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diagnostics rely on empirical band ratios, which often suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias. We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.

### [11] [Abundances in 78 metal-rich bulge spheroid stars from APOGEE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12415)
*H. Ernandes,B. Barbuy,C. Chiappini,S. Feltzing,A. Pérez-Villegas,A. C. S. Friaça,S. O. Souza,R. P. Nunes,A. B. A. Queiroz,J. G. Fernández-Trincado,A. L. Rocha de Abreu,A. Plotnikova*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of metal-rich bulge stars ([Fe/H] > -0.8) reveals distinct chemical signatures including phosphorus and cerium excess at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7, suggesting early bulge formation, plus a super-solar metallicity population with enhanced K/Mn and low Ce/Fe linked to nuclear disc/bar enrichment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain the properties of the earliest spheroidal bulge population by studying metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] > -0.8), complementing previous analysis of metal-poor bulge stars, and to understand the chemical evolution and formation history of the inner Galaxy including contributions from the bar, disc, and accretion events.

Method: Applied kinematical and dynamical criteria to select metal-rich bulge stars ([Fe/H] > -0.8) from APOGEE DR17 data. Derived individual abundances for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce through spectral synthesis. Compared results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. Used chemical abundance diagrams ([Mg/Mn] vs [Al/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] vs [(C+N)/O]) to trace stellar origins.

Result: Alpha elements (Mg, Si, Ca) and iron-peak elements (V, Cr, Co, Ni) follow expected trends. Mn shows secondary behavior. S and K display significant scatter but remain broadly compatible. Phosphorus and cerium show excess around [Fe/H] ~ -0.7, more pronounced than in metal-poor sample. Chemical diagrams indicate in situ origin for most stars. At super-solar metallicities, a subset shows enhanced K and Mn (possibly S) with low [Ce/Fe], suggesting enrichment linked to nuclear disc and bar.

Conclusion: The metal-rich bulge population reveals distinctive chemical signatures: P and Ce excess at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7 marks the earliest bulge population, while enhanced K/Mn with low Ce/Fe at super-solar metallicities traces a chemically distinct population shaped by the nuclear disc and bar, providing evidence for multiple formation pathways in the inner Galaxy.

Abstract: The inner Galaxy is the most complex region of the Milky Way, comprising the bulge, inner thin and thick discs, and inner halo; the formation of the bar transferred gas and stars from the disc inward. Accretion of dwarf galaxies also occurred over the Galaxy's lifetime, merging with the original bulge. In this work, we constrain the metal-rich stars of the earliest spheroidal bulge. To study the oldest bulge stars, distributed in a spheroid, we applied kinematical and dynamical criteria in the metal-rich range [Fe/H] > -0.8. This complements our previous analysis of a symmetric sample with [Fe/H] < -0.8. We derived individual abundances through spectral synthesis for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce using stellar parameters from APOGEE DR17, and compared the results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. The alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca, and iron-peak elements V, Cr, Co, and Ni follow the expected trends relative to the models. Mn shows secondary behaviour. S and K display significant star-to-star scatter but remain broadly compatible with predictions. Phosphorus and cerium show an excess around [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.7, more pronounced than in the metal-poor sample, suggesting a distinctive signature of the earliest bulge population. Diagrams of [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] versus [(C+N)/O] indicate an in situ origin for most stars. At super-solar metallicities, a subset shows enhanced K and Mn (possibly S) with low [Ce/Fe], hinting at enrichment linked to the nuclear disc and bar, and tracing a chemically distinct population shaped by the innermost Galaxy.

*Guoqing Tang,Jiang He,Zhao Wang,Dong Qiu*

TL;DR: A graph neural network framework predicts PAH infrared spectra 10,000× faster than quantum methods, with Attentive Fingerprint performing best using Jensen-Shannon divergence loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAHs are key to understanding aromatic infrared bands in space, but their structural diversity makes reliable reference spectra computation challenging with traditional quantum chemical methods.

Method: Developed efficient GNN framework to predict PAH absorption spectra; evaluated four architectures (GCN, GAT, MPNN, AFP); trained AFP with five spectral distance metrics as loss functions.

Result: AFP model delivers best overall performance; Jensen-Shannon divergence yields most accurate and stable results; performs best for PAHs with 20-40 carbon atoms; accuracy decreases for larger molecules due to limited training data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future analysis of aromatic infrared bands in space.

Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as the primary contributors to the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) widely observed in space. However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis.

*Bocheng Zhu,Liang Gao*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A new subgrid framework in Arepo code simulates Pop III and Pop II star formation with feedback effects, achieving high resolution and reproducing JWST-observed SFRD while studying metal enrichment and convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of Population III (first generation) stellar feedback on early universe star formation, particularly how it affects metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, using a comprehensive subgrid framework that can be computationally tractable for larger simulations.

Method: Implemented a Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework in the moving-mesh code Arepo, combining primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with supernova feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner and ionizing radiation transport. Ran simulations in 1 cMpc/h boxes from z=127 to z=10 with varying initial conditions and resolutions, achieving gas mass resolution of ~10 M⊙ and spatial resolution of ~4 pc.

Result: The model successfully reproduces JWST-observed UV-inferred Pop II SFRD across all initial conditions. Metal-enriched gas volume filling factor converges to ~1% at z=10. Convergence is achieved when subhalos with mass ≳10^6.5 M⊙ are resolved. Total stellar mass at z=10 is largely insensitive to initial conditions or resolution. A fiducial simulation requires ~10^4 CPU hours.

Conclusion: The framework is computationally tractable and successfully models early universe star formation with Pop III feedback, enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics variations (Pop III IMF, X-ray radiation, streaming velocity) and environmental effects in larger simulation boxes.

Abstract: We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.

### [14] [Odd Radio Circles Modeled by Shock-Bubble Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12479)
*Yiting Wang,Sebastian Heinz*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ORCs are explained as synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by Richtmyer-Meshkov instability when shocks interact with fossil radio lobes in the IGM, matching observed properties without requiring host galaxy centering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the physical nature and origins of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), a newly discovered class of astronomical objects whose formation mechanisms remain unclear.

Method: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with a new scale-free method to model Inverse-Compton and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies, enabling testing of wide parameter ranges against observational constraints.

Result: Shock strengths of Mach 2-4 match data; initial bubble sizes of 140-250 kpc with energies of 10^57-10^59 erg explain rings; ORCs exist in low-density environments (outskirts of galaxy groups) with ages of 70-200 Myr; synthetic maps match ORC1 polarization and predict magnetic field angle dependency on aspect ratio.

Conclusion: The RMI-driven vortex ring model successfully explains ORC properties without requiring them to be centered on host galaxies, making it redshift-agnostic and consistent with fossil radio lobes from moderately powerful radio galaxies.

Abstract: The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.

### [15] [The Structure and Evolution of LRDs: Insights from JWST NIRSpec Medium and High Resolution Spectroscopy at $z\sim4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12548)
*Yuxuan Pang,Xin Wang,Cheng Cheng,Shengzhe Wang,Hang Zhou,Qianqiao Zhou,Xue-Bing Wu,Karl Glazebrook*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST/NIRSpec analysis of 11 LRDs at z~4 reveals AGN-driven broad Hα correlated with optical continuum, while [O III] correlates with UV continuum. Black hole masses of 10^6-10^8 M⊙ accreting at high Eddington ratios suggest early rapid growth phase. Proposed "Clumpy Envelope" model explains extended optical emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the physical nature and central engines of Luminous Red Dwarfs (LRDs) at high redshift (z~4) using JWST's high-resolution spectroscopy capabilities, particularly examining the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua in this population.

Method: Analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at z~4. Decomposition of broad and narrow components of Balmer emission lines. Estimation of black hole masses using broad Hα line width and luminosity. Application of slim-disk models with constant mass accretion rates. Development of "Clumpy Envelope" model to explain extended optical emission.

Result: Broad Hα luminosity strongly correlates with optical continuum (not UV), indicating common AGN origin. [O III] strength correlates with UV continuum rather than optical. Black hole masses estimated at 10^6-10^8 M⊙ with high Eddington ratios (λ_Edd ~ 0.6). Growth timescales of ~10^5-10^7 years. LRDs show intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. Proposed "Clumpy Envelope" model with characteristic radius of tens of light-days explains optical emission diversity.

Conclusion: LRDs represent an early, rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution, likely evolving into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The "Clumpy Envelope" model successfully explains the extended optical emission and continuum diversity. JWST high-resolution spectroscopy proves powerful for probing central engines and physical nature of high-redshift LRD populations.

Abstract: We present an analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at $z \sim 4$. By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$α$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$α$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($λ_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\sim 10^5-10^7\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a "Clumpy Envelope" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA Band 9 observations reveal a warm, dense ring-like structure around a Class 0 protostar in MC 27/L1521F using CO(J=6-5) line, indicating localized shock heating from gas-magnetic field interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the earliest evolution history of protostars by characterizing warm envelope components through high-excitation molecular lines, which remain scarce in interferometric observations despite their potential to reveal temperature and density distributions encoded in shocks from infall and outflows.

Method: ALMA Band 9 observations targeting the CO(J=6-5) line at ~2" angular resolution (~300 au) of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F hosting a Class 0 protostar, enabling detection of previously unidentified structures by overcoming optical depth limitations of low-J CO data.

Result: Detection of an off-centered ring-like structure (~1000 au diameter) with ~3 K peak brightness temperature, arising from warm (T ≳ 20 K) and dense (n(H₂) ≳ 10⁵ cm⁻³) gas embedded within the cold dense core, suggesting energetic localized shock heating potentially linked to gas-magnetic field interactions.

Conclusion: High-J CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components in protostellar environments, enabling more direct investigation of physical processes operating at the onset of star formation, particularly dynamical gas-magnetic field interactions.

Abstract: Infall and outflows, coupled with magnetic fields, rapidly structure the gas around newborn protostars. Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\sim$2\arcsec\ ($\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase. Our results demonstrate that high-$J$ CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components, enabling a more direct view of the physical processes operating at the onset of star formation.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: PrestaLine: Gorynych is a numerical tool for modeling molecular core collapse from prestellar to protostellar phases, integrating hydrodynamics, chemistry, and radiative transfer to simulate and analyze low- and high-mass core evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive numerical framework that couples theoretical collapse models with observational data, enabling diagnosis of core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line spectra.

Method: The code integrates three modules: Kamelung (1D hydrodynamics for gravitational collapse and accretion), Presta (chemical evolution post-processing), and Uran(IA) (radiative transfer for synthetic spectra). Applied to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores.

Result: Dynamical evolution is remarkably similar between low- and high-mass cores, differing mainly in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution shows sharp abundance changes during first hydrostatic core transition for CO, H2O, and HCO+, with pre-collapse initialization having minimal impact. Spectral maps reveal distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores showing spatially extended emission.

Conclusion: Gorynych provides a valuable framework for coupling theoretical collapse models with observations, enabling diagnosis of core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line data, with applications to both low- and high-mass star formation.

Abstract: We present PrestaLine: Gorynych, a comprehensive numerical tool designed to model the dynamical, chemical, and spectral evolution of collapsing molecular cores from the prestellar phase to protostellar accretion. The code integrates three key components: (1) Kamelung, a 1D hydrodynamics module simulating gravitational collapse up to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation followed by an accretion of envelope onto a young star; (2) Presta, a chemical evolution module post-processing density and temperature profiles to compute time-dependent molecular abundances; and (3) Uran(IA), a radiative transfer module generating synthetic molecular line spectra. We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission. Our results highlight Gorynych's utility to couple theoretical collapse models and observations, providing a framework to diagnose core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line data.

TL;DR: Calibration of OPT-IR luminosity relation for quasars using SED fitting to assess contaminations and develop empirical calibrations for cosmological applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To calibrate the OPT-IR luminosity relation for quasars as a cosmological probe by accurately estimating dusty torus and accretion disk luminosities while addressing contamination from host galaxy components.

Method: Analyzed ~400 quasars across four redshift bins (0.7-2.4) using CIGALE code for full SED fitting, compared with simplified photometric estimates, and assessed contaminations from polar dust, interstellar medium, and stellar emission.

Result: Photometric estimates match SED-based values for disk luminosity >10^45 erg/s; polar dust minimally affects luminosity but significantly alters SED fitting parameters; optical dominated by stellar contamination, IR by disk emission and cold dust; proposed two empirical calibrations.

Conclusion: Simplified photometric methods are reliable for high-luminosity quasars (disk >10^45-10^46 erg/s, torus >1.6×10^45-2×10^46 erg/s depending on redshift), enabling development of OPT-IR relation as cosmological probe.

Abstract: The main objective is to calibrate the OPT-IR luminosity relation for quasars, focusing on accurate estimations of dusty torus and accretion disk luminosities. We analyzed contaminations related to host galaxies, particularly from polar dust, the interstellar medium, and stellar emission that affect the optical and infrared. We used a sample of nearly 400 quasars with photometrical observations and spectroscopical redshift divided into four redshift bins (0.7-2.4). Full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed with the CIGALE code, and results were compared with simplified photometric luminosity estimates. The impact of non-active galactic nucleus components and the role of polar dust in the fitting process were assessed. We show that for sources with a disk luminosity above 10^45 [erg/s], the photometric estimates are consistent with SED-based values. While polar dust contributes marginally to luminosity, its presence significantly alters SED fitting, particularly the torus opening angle and cold dust properties. In the optical domain, stellar emission is the dominant contamination. In the infrared, disk emission and cold dust play major roles. We propose two empirical calibrations for the OPT-IR relation. We conclude that the optical band is dominated by the accretion disk component above 10^45 or 10^46 [erg/s] depending on redshift, while IR luminosity is dominated by the dusty torus emission above 1.6 $\times$ 10^45 or 2 $\times$ 10^46 [erg/s] depending on the redshift. In this high-luminosity regime, simplified photometric methods yield reliable disk and torus luminosity estimates. The aim of the analysis we present is to test the parameter space in order to build a well behaving OPT-IR nonlinear luminosity relation for quasars that could serve as a cosmological probe.

TL;DR: No significant HF absorption detected in a z=6.024 galaxy, placing stringent upper limits on fluorine abundance that challenge WR star enrichment models in the early Universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the contribution of Wolf-Rayet stars to fluorine production in the early Universe by measuring HF absorption in a young, high-redshift galaxy where low-mass AGB stars cannot have contributed significantly.

Method: ALMA Band 5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at z=6.024 with known gas-phase metallicity, using a galaxy too young for AGB star contributions to isolate massive-star yields.

Result: No significant HF absorption detected (~2σ), with a conservative 5σ upper limit of N_HF/N_H2 < 2.2×10^-9, about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment ~0.9 Gyr after the Big Bang.

Conclusion: The constraint is consistent with chemical evolution models without WR yields at this epoch, suggesting that expanding HF absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies with well-characterized metallicities is crucial for tracing the onset of WR enrichment and fluorine production across cosmic time.

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have recently attracted attention as possible drivers of early chemical enrichment, including the production of fluorine, whose nucleosynthetic origin remains debated. To test the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band~5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=6.024$. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to isolate massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption ($\sim2σ$) and derive a conservative 5$σ$ upper limit of $N_\mathrm{HF}/N_\mathrm{H_2} < 2.2\times10^{-9}$. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment $\sim0.9$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Comparison with chemical evolution models shows that our constraint is consistent with scenarios without WR yields at this epoch. Expanding the sample of HF absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies with well-characterized metallicities will be crucial for tracing the onset of WR enrichment and fluorine production across cosmic time.

*Muryel Guolo*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Off-nuclear tidal disruption events reveal wandering black holes in massive early-type galaxies, with demographics explained by hierarchical galaxy formation and tidal stripping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the population of wandering black holes (WBHs) revealed by off-nuclear tidal disruption events and explain their observed demographic trends using cosmological simulations.

Method: Analysis of three new off-nuclear TDEs combined with the first known source, using ROMULUS cosmological simulations and empirical constraints on local galaxy populations to compute WBH volumetric density.

Result: WBH density peaks at log10(M⋆/M⊙)=11.10, with over half residing in galaxies with 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.2, explaining observed trends; link between stellar counterpart detection and halo-centric radius explained by tidal stripping.

Conclusion: Off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of wandering black holes predicted by cosmological simulations, with observed demographics naturally arising from hierarchical galaxy formation processes.

Abstract: The recent discovery of three off-nuclear tidal disruption events (EP240222a, AT2024tvd, and AT2025abcr) - following the first such source, 3XMM J2150$-$05 - reveals a small but robust population of off-nuclear, or `wandering', black holes (WBHs) with masses $M_\bullet > 10^4 M_\odot$. Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\star \sim 10^7 M_\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs, $φ_{\rm WBH}(M_\star)$, finding that it peaks at $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)=11.10^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe reside in galaxies with $10.7 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.2$, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST enables simultaneous measurement of electron density and temperature in high-redshift galaxies using OIII] and [OIII] lines, revealing extreme physical conditions (ne ~ 3×10⁵ cm⁻³, Te ~ 20,000 K) that significantly affect metallicity estimates and challenge reported N/O overabundances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST's unprecedented UV and optical coverage allows for simultaneous constraints on electron density and temperature in high-redshift galaxies, addressing limitations of previous methods that couldn't self-consistently determine both parameters and potentially led to inaccurate metallicity and abundance measurements.

Method: Developed a self-consistent direct method using multiple OIII] (1661,66 Å) and [OIII] (4363, 5007 Å) transitions that is insensitive to a wide range of electron densities due to the high critical densities of these lines. Applied this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9.

Result: Found extreme physical conditions in high-redshift galaxies: electron densities up to ne ~ 3×10⁵ cm⁻³ and temperatures Te ~ 20,000 K at z>6. Accounting for these densities changes derived Te and modifies inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex. Showed that reported N/O overabundances arise from high N³⁺/H⁺ values from NIV] lines, and that temperature stratification could reduce inferred N/O by nearly 50% if Te(N³⁺) is 10% higher than Te([OIII]).

Conclusion: The new self-consistent method reveals extreme physical conditions in high-redshift galaxies that significantly impact metallicity and abundance measurements. Classical N/O diagnostics can be misleading in high-density gas, while N²⁺/O²⁺ ratios place these galaxies closer to local systems. Future JWST programs with larger samples are needed to test the universality of these results.

Abstract: The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n$_{\rm e}$) and temperature (T$_{\rm e}$) of ionized gas in galaxies at z>5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($λ$4363, and $λ$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\rm e}$$\sim 3\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\rm e}$ $\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z>6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\rm e}$ than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\% higher than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.

TL;DR: Local post-starburst galaxies show two-phase quenching starbursts consistent with gas-rich mergers: first outer weaker/slower bursts, then central stronger/faster bursts, with quenching driven by gas consumption and spheroid stabilization rather than AGN feedback.

Motivation: Post-starburst galaxies provide unique insights into starburst and quenching mechanisms, with spatially-resolved properties from integral-field spectroscopy revealing directional patterns linked to past evolution.

Method: Used hierarchical Bayesian modeling on MaNGA survey data to measure resolved star-formation histories, stellar metallicity evolution, and dust properties of three local PSBs at 0.5" resolution (~0.3 kpc), constraining local parameters simultaneously with spatial trend parameters.

Result: All three galaxies exhibited two-phase quenching: first outer weaker/slower starbursts, followed by central stronger/faster starbursts peaking ~1 Gyr later. Central bursts induced stronger metallicity rises. Non-axisymmetric features in burst mass fraction and dust maps suggest tidal merger effects.

Conclusion: Results are consistent with gas-rich merger scenario where first pericenter passage triggers outer starbursts and coalescence triggers central starbursts. Rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and spheroid stabilization against gravitational collapse, not primarily by AGN feedback.

Abstract: Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$" resolution ($\sim0.3\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\sim 1\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.

### [23] [H$_2$ Ortho-Para Spin Conversion on Inhomogeneous Grain Surfaces. II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13122)
*Kenji Furuya,Toshiki Sugimoto,Kazunari Iwasaki,Masashi Tsuge,Naoki Watanabe*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper investigates how nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains affects H₂ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and deuterium fractionation in star-forming regions, focusing on how surface interactions modify the rotational energy difference between ortho- and para-H₂.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies assumed the rotational energy difference between ortho-H₂ and para-H₂ on grain surfaces is the same as in gas phase (170.5 K), but surface interactions likely reduce this difference, affecting NSC rates and thus H₂ OPR evolution and deuterium fractionation in cold star-forming regions.

Method: The authors relax the assumption of constant 170.5 K energy difference and re-evaluate NSC rates with varying rotational energy differences between adsorbed ortho- and para-H₂ ground states. They incorporate these re-evaluated rates into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study evolution in prestellar cores and protostellar envelope outer regions.

Result: NSC on grains reduces the timescale of H₂ OPR evolution and deuterium fractionation at densities >10⁴ cm⁻³ and temperatures <14-16 K (depending on rotational energy difference), when H₂ ionization rate is 10⁻¹⁷ s⁻¹.

Conclusion: Surface interactions significantly affect H₂ ortho-para rotational energy differences, and including NSC on grains with realistic energy differences is crucial for accurately modeling H₂ OPR evolution and deuterium fractionation in cold, dense star-forming regions.

Abstract: We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.
