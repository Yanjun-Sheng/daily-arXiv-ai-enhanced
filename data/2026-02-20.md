TL;DR: Analysis of how averaging scale affects magnetic/kinetic turbulence characterization in galaxy simulations, showing turbulence strength depends more on smoothing scale than initial conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the choice of averaging scale impacts the measurement and characterization of magnetic and kinetic turbulence in Milky Way-sized galaxies, particularly for interpreting observations and simulations.

Method: Analyzed two MHD simulations of isolated disk galaxies with different initial magnetic morphologies (toroidal vs random fields). Used spherical filtering to decompose fields into mean/fluctuating components while varying averaging scale, examining energy ratios and power spectra over time and radius.

Result: Both models developed ordered and turbulent magnetic structures with strengths varying strongly with averaging radius. Power spectra steepened with increasing smoothing scale, tracing coherent-to-turbulent transitions. Turbulent kinetic energy dominated magnetic but remained significant. Turbulence fractions depended more on averaging radius than initial conditions.

Conclusion: Characterization of turbulence as strong/weak depends sensitively on chosen averaging scale rather than being intrinsic to the system. This has direct implications for observational magnetic field estimates (e.g., Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique), emphasizing need for careful scale selection.

Abstract: In interstellar medium studies, separating ordered and random velocity or magnetic fields is essential for interpreting turbulence in both simulations and observations. We investigate how the choice of averaging scale affects the measurement and characterization of magnetic and kinetic turbulence in Milky Way-sized disk galaxies with different initial magnetic morphologies. We analyze two magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies, one initialized with a toroidal magnetic field (Model T) and the other with a random field (Model R). Using spherical filtering, we decompose the magnetic and velocity fields into mean and fluctuating components while varying the averaging scale, and examine their energy ratios and power spectra as functions of time and averaging radius. Both models develop ordered and turbulent magnetic structures, whose relative strengths vary strongly with the averaging radius. The power spectra of the velocity and magnetic mean fields steepen with increasing smoothing scale, tracing the transition from coherent to turbulent regimes. The turbulent kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic counterpart, though the latter remains dynamically significant. Very importantly, we find that these ratios depend more strongly on the averaging radius than on the initial conditions of the magnetic field. The characterization of turbulence as strong or weak, meaning whether or not fluctuations dominate over the mean depends sensitively on the chosen averaging scale, rather than being an intrinsic property of the system. The strong dependence of the turbulence fractions on the averaging scale has direct implications for magnetic field estimates obtained from observational methods such as the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique emphasizing the need for careful scale selection when interpreting magnetic and kinetic turbulence in galaxies.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of velocity anisotropy profiles in massive galaxy clusters shows orbital anisotropy increases from center to virial radius, with similar patterns across different galaxy populations, plus a notable drop at ~250 kpc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure the velocity anisotropy profile β(r) of different galaxy cluster member populations using stacked projected phase space analysis of massive clusters, improving precision over previous studies with enhanced member identification.

Method: Used nine massive clusters (M200c > 7×10¹⁴ M⊙) at intermediate redshifts (0.18 < z < 0.45) from CLASH-VLT spectroscopic program, selected for roundness and virialization. Employed complementary MUSE observations to identify unprecedented number of cluster members. Divided members into four classes by color (red/blue) and stellar mass (high/low). Applied two parallel techniques: MAMPOSSt (parametric in β(r)) and Jeans equation inversion (non-parametric in β(r)). Explored 72 model combinations with MAMPOSSt and 18 with Jeans inversion.

Result: Both techniques show agreement: orbital anisotropy grows from center (β ≈ 0.2-0.4) to virial radius (β ≳ 0.8), similar across different cluster member populations. Jeans inversion reveals a drop in β(r) at ~250 kpc from cluster center. Robust anisotropy estimates obtained through extensive model exploration.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive velocity anisotropy profiles for galaxy clusters, establishing that orbital anisotropy increases radially outward and is consistent across galaxy populations, with an interesting dynamical feature at ~250 kpc. This extensive investigation forms a solid basis for future studies on cluster dynamical masses and cosmology in large spectroscopic survey era.

Abstract: We measure the velocity anisotropy profile $β(r)$ of different galaxy cluster member populations by analysing the stacked projected phase space of nine massive ($M_\mathrm{200c}>7\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts ($0.18 < z < 0.45$). We select our sample of galaxy clusters by choosing the most round and virialised objects among the targets of the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic program, which offers a large spectral database. Complementary MUSE observations on most of these clusters allowed us to identify an unprecedented number of cluster members, strongly enhancing the precision of our measurement with respect to previous studies. Our sample of cluster members is divided in four classes: red and blue by colour, and high- and low-mass by stellar mass. We employ two parallel techniques, namely the MAMPOSSt method (parametric in $β(r)$) and the Jeans equation inversion (non parametric in $β(r)$). The results from both techniques are found in agreement for any given cluster member population, and suggest that the orbital anisotropy in galaxy clusters grows from the centre (where $β\approx 0.2-0.4$) to the virial radius ($β\gtrsim 0.8$), and it is similar for the different cluster member populations. We also find an interesting dynamical feature in the Jeans inversion results, that is a drop in $β(r)$ at a distance of $\sim 250$ kpc from the cluster centre. We provide robust anisotropy estimates by exploring a highly significant number of model combinations: 72 with MAMPOSSt (varying the mass, surface number density, $β(r)$ model, and galaxy population) and 18 (varying total mass model and galaxy population) in the Jeans inversion. Such an extensive investigation of the $β(r)$ profile in galaxy clusters is a wide basis for future studies on cluster dynamical masses and cluster cosmology in the era of large spectroscopic surveys

TL;DR: LRDs (Little Red Dots) observed by JWST may be forming globular clusters powered by supermassive stars rather than accreting black holes, with spectral properties and luminosity evolution consistent with local globular cluster populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative explanation for Little Red Dots (LRDs) - that they are forming globular clusters with supermassive stars rather than accreting supermassive black holes, providing a new perspective on these enigmatic high-redshift sources.

Method: Analyze LRD spectral profiles, compare with models of young stellar populations and supermassive stars, examine UV luminosity function evolution from z~5-7 to present day, and estimate total number densities across redshifts.

Result: LRD spectral profiles are broadly consistent with young stellar populations and supermassive stars, though temperatures/luminosities suggest reprocessing by optically thick winds. The LRD UV luminosity function evolves into a present-day mass function matching local globular clusters with turnover at log10(M*/M⊙)=5.3. Total present-day number density ≈0.3 Mpc⁻³ matches local globular clusters.

Conclusion: LRDs may represent globular clusters in formation, offering a local perspective on distant sources and a window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe, with predicted chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations.

Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.

### [4] [Exploring the Near Galactic Centre: A Comprehensive Study of Bulge OCs HSC 25, HSC 37, HSC 2878 Utilising Gaia DR3 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15937)

TL;DR: Study of three open clusters in the Galactic disc's innermost regions reveals diverse evolutionary stages, masses, and orbital dynamics suggesting heterogeneous origins - some dynamically heated/accreted, others formed in situ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the photometric and kinematic properties of open clusters in the innermost Galactic disc regions to understand their evolutionary stages, dynamical states, and origins within the Milky Way.

Method: Utilized Gaia DR3 data with the UPMASK membership algorithm to identify most probable cluster members, then performed comprehensive photometric and kinematic analysis including proper motions, ages, distances, metallicities, masses, and orbital parameter calculations.

Result: Identified 44, 55, and 112 members for HSC 25, 37, and 2878 respectively; found significant mass differences (135, 755, 204 M☉); determined diverse ages (log(t/yr)=8.38, 7.04, 9.04); revealed HSC 25 and 2878 are dynamically evolved while HSC 37 is in early evolution; orbital analysis shows HSC 25 and 37 have eccentric orbits suggesting heated/accreted origins, while HSC 2878 has relaxed planar orbit indicating in situ formation.

Conclusion: The three clusters exhibit heterogeneous dynamical origins within the inner Milky Way, with some likely dynamically heated or accreted and others formed in situ, providing insights into star formation and evolution processes in the Galactic bulge region.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.

### [5] [The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15940)
*Jose M. Diego*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST observations reveal globular clusters in AS1063 tracing dark matter distribution but with smaller cores, challenging standard dark matter models and suggesting self-interacting dark matter with velocity-dependent cross-section.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between globular cluster distribution and dark matter in galaxy clusters, and to test dark matter models through observed core sizes in AS1063.

Method: Analysis of deep JWST images of galaxy cluster AS1063, comparison of globular cluster distribution with lensing mass (dark matter) distribution, and evaluation of different dark matter models against observed core sizes.

Result: Globular clusters trace dark matter distribution but have cores about half the size of dark matter cores; standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter struggle to explain large cores, while self-interacting dark matter with σ_SI ≈ 0.3 cm² g⁻¹ offers natural explanation.

Conclusion: Current limitations in hydrodynamical N-body simulations prevent definitive ruling out of standard dark matter, but future high-resolution simulations with trillions of particles could transform dark matter understanding from epistemic to ontological nature.

Abstract: Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $σ_{\rm SI}\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one

TL;DR: LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 3 (LoTSS-DR3) presents 88% northern sky coverage at 120-168 MHz with 6 arcsec resolution, cataloging 13.7 million sources from 12,950 hours of data, achieving 92 μJy/beam median sensitivity with 6% random flux scale error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To release the third major data product from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, providing unprecedented low-frequency radio sky coverage with high angular resolution and sensitivity for studying the northern sky radio source population.

Method: Used direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines to correct for instrumental effects and ionospheric distortions; processed 12,950 hours (18.6 PB) of data over 10.5 years; created 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with 6 arcsec resolution; performed completeness simulations accounting for realistic source models, time/bandwidth-smearing, and astrometric errors.

Result: Cataloged 13,667,877 sources from 16,943,656 Gaussian components; achieved median sensitivity of 92 μJy/beam; astrometric precision shows systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec; random flux density scale error is 6% with systematic offset within 2%; completeness >95% for compact sources exceeding 9× local RMS noise; source counts match injected counts above 45× local RMS noise.

Conclusion: LoTSS-DR3 provides comprehensive low-frequency radio sky coverage with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, constraining radio source population over five orders of magnitude; all data products are publicly available including catalogues, images, and calibration solutions.

Abstract: We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions.

### [7] [Is the overconcentration of pristine populations in Galactic globular clusters real? An N-body approach to the problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15953)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Direct N-body simulations confirm that apparent central concentration of pristine RGB stars in some globular clusters is a transient effect caused by black hole subsystem interactions, validating earlier Monte Carlo predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To independently test the interpretation that observed central concentration of pristine red giant branch stars in some Milky Way globular clusters is a transient effect arising from interactions with black hole subsystems, rather than contradicting multiple stellar population formation scenarios.

Method: Performed direct N-body simulations using NBODY6++GPU code with tailored initial conditions to reproduce relevant dynamical regime. Simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and Galactic tidal field for direct comparison with earlier MOCCA Monte Carlo results.

Result: Simulations confirm that spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars are strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with black hole subsystems. Preferential ejection of enriched (2P) RGB stars and their progenitors from cluster center leads to transient apparent overconcentration of pristine (1P) RGB stars, validating earlier MOCCA predictions.

Conclusion: The apparent contradiction between observations and multiple stellar population formation scenarios is resolved - the overconcentration of pristine RGB stars is a transient dynamical effect in clusters with significant mass loss and active black hole subsystems, not a violation of formation predictions.

Abstract: Recent observations indicate that in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars appear more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. This contradicts most multiple stellar population (MSP) formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched (second) population (2P) should initially be more concentrated than the pristine (first) population (1P). Previous MOCCA Monte Carlo simulations suggested that this apparent overconcentration is a transient effect arising in clusters that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass and host an active black hole subsystem (BHS), and is visible only when RGB stars are used as tracers. In this letter, we test this interpretation using tailored NBODY6++GPU models evolved with direct N-body simulations, providing an independent validation that does not rely on a statistical treatment of relaxation. We performed direct N-body simulations with the NBODY6++GPU code, adopting initial conditions designed to reproduce the dynamical regime relevant to the proposed mechanism. The simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and the Galactic tidal field, enabling a direct comparison with MOCCA results. The simulations confirm that the spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars can be strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with the BHS. Preferential ejection of 2P RGB and their progenitors from the cluster center leads to a transient apparent overconcentration of 1P RGB stars, in agreement with earlier MOCCA predictions.

TL;DR: Overview paper on using stellar microlensing to probe dark matter as compact objects, particularly primordial black holes, summarizing current constraints and future prospects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stellar microlensing provides a powerful method to detect and constrain dark matter in the form of compact objects like primordial black holes, addressing fundamental questions about dark matter composition.

Method: Review paper synthesizing historical development, theoretical foundations, observational techniques, and current constraints from microlensing surveys for compact object dark matter detection.

Result: Current microlensing observations exclude compact objects in the mass range 10^{-11} to 10^4 solar masses from making up all dark matter, establishing important constraints on primordial black hole scenarios.

Conclusion: Stellar microlensing remains a crucial observational tool for testing dark matter as compact objects, with ongoing and future surveys expected to further refine constraints and potentially detect signatures.

Abstract: Stellar microlensing is a powerful tool for probing dark matter in the form of planetary and stellar mass compact objects (COs), in particular primordial black holes (PBHs). Under standard assumptions, current observations exclude COs in the mass range $10^{-11} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$ making up all of the dark matter. We provide an overview, aimed at theorists working on PBHs, of the history, theory, observational status, and future prospects of the field.

TL;DR: WEAVE IFU observations of 5 jellyfish galaxies in Coma cluster reveal that tail emission is dominated by ram-pressure-driven shocks rather than star formation, with LINER-like diagnostics and enhanced line ratios/velocities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jellyfish galaxies represent extreme cases of ram pressure stripping (RPS) effects, but the nature of ionized emission in their tails remains unclear - whether from star formation or other processes like shocks.

Method: Used WEAVE Large-IFU observations of 5 jellyfish galaxies from Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS), comparing emission line properties between disks and tails, analyzing BPT diagnostics, line ratios, and velocity measurements.

Result: Tail emission is not dominated by star formation; shows LINER-like characteristics with enhanced [OI]/Hα ratios; elevated [OII]/Hα ratios in tails; similarly high emission line velocities and dispersions in tails compared to disks.

Conclusion: Ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails, rather than star formation, as evidenced by shock diagnostics in line ratios and kinematics.

Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies, which exhibit tails of gas opposite to their direction of motion, are a galaxy population showcasing the most extreme effects of ram pressure stripping (RPS). We present the emission line properties of a preliminary sample of five jellyfish galaxies in the Coma cluster, observed with the WEAVE Large-IFU as part of the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS). When complete, CLIFS will form a sample of 29 jellyfish galaxies in Coma, selected based on the presence of one-sided tails in the radio continuum, enabling a comprehensive picture of the effects of ram pressure on galaxies in the Coma cluster. We extract emission line properties and confirm consistency between disk fluxes measured from WEAVE and MaNGA for galaxies with overlapping disk coverage between surveys. Comparing resolved radio and H$α$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$α$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$α$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks. These results demonstrate that ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails.

TL;DR: Analysis of Orion Nebula Cluster disks using NIRCam imaging reveals three disk types based on dissociation/ionization front positions, shows disk radii scaling with distance from ionizing source consistent with photoevaporation truncation, and identifies dust segregation and PDR thermal pressure trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster by analyzing their structural properties, radiation environment effects, and evolutionary states using high-resolution near-infrared observations.

Method: Used high angular resolution NIRCam images from PDRs4All and GTO program 1256 to measure disk radii in silhouette, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen α intensities, derive near-infrared SEDs, and establish a disk typology based on DF/IF positions relative to disk surfaces.

Result: Identified three disk types: Type I (merged IFs/DFs near disk surface), Type II (DFs at surface, IFs tens of AU away), Type III (DFs at surface, no IF). Found disk radius scales with projected distance to ionizing source as r_disk ∝ d_proj^0.30, consistent with photoevaporation truncation. Infrared disk radii larger than millimeter wavelengths indicate radial dust segregation. PDR thermal pressure increases with FUV field G_0 but with flatter slope than models. JuMBO SEDs resemble Type III disks except JuMBO24, which matches Type I/II sources.

Conclusion: The study establishes a comprehensive typology for ONC disks based on their interaction with UV radiation, demonstrates photoevaporation as a key disk truncation mechanism, reveals dust segregation within disks, and provides insights into the nature of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects in the cluster.

Abstract: We use the high angular resolution NIRCam images from the \textit{PDRs4All} program, combined with those of GTO program 1256, to extract key properties of disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We measure disk radii in silhouette against the bright background, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen $α$ intensities, and derive near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs). From these diagnostics we define a typology of ONC disks. \textit{Type I} sources show merged IFs and DFs close to the disk surface. \textit{Type II} sources have DFs at the disk surface and IFs located tens of astronomical units away. \textit{Type III} sources show a DF at the disk surface but no IF. For all types, PAH emission traces the PDR. We find that the disk radius $r{\rm disk}$ increases with projected distance to the ionizing source $d{\rm proj}$, following $r{\rm disk} \propto d{\rm proj}^{0.30}$, consistent with disk truncation by photoevaporation. Disk radii measured in the infrared are larger than those measured at millimeter wavelengths, suggesting radial dust segregation within the disks. In agreement with PDR models, the thermal pressure in the disk PDR increases with the FUV radiation field $G_0$, but with a flatter slope. Finally, the SEDs of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) are similar to those of \textit{Type III} disks, except for JuMBO24, which resembles a \textit{Type I} or \textit{Type II} source. Its SED is consistent with a young low-mass binary hosting an unresolved ionized disk.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A simple bursty star formation model with power-law distributed burst masses and ~100 Myr quiescence periods can explain observed high-redshift galaxy properties in the M_UV vs M_* plane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether bursty star formation with standard IMF and no continuous star formation, mergers, or dust can explain observed properties of galaxies at z>5, motivated by JWST observations and cosmological simulations.

Method: Use a simple parametric, phenomenological model of bursty star formation with quiescence periods between bursts, linear stellar mass growth over time, and power-law distribution of burst masses across galaxies.

Result: The simplest fitting model has quiescence period Δt ~ 100 Myr, linear stellar mass growth from z=12 to z=5, and burst mass distribution following power-law dN/dM_* ∝ M_*^α with α ~ -2. At z>9-10, galaxies typically had only 1-2 bursts.

Conclusion: Bursty star formation with standard IMF and no continuous star formation, mergers, or dust can account for observed high-redshift galaxy properties, with burst masses following a power-law distribution and ~100 Myr quiescence periods.

Abstract: Motivated by observational evidence from JWST and theoretical results from cosmological simulations, we use a simple parametric, phenomenological model to test to what extent bursty star formation with standard Initial Mass Function, no continuous star formation, no mergers, \mr{and no dust} can account for the observed properties in the $M_{UV}$ vs $M_*$ plane of galaxies at redshifts $z>5$. We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts $Δt \sim 100$~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from $z=12$ to $z=5$ (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law $dN/dM_* \propto M_*^α$ with slope $α\sim -2$.
  At $z>9-10$ the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching $M_* \sim 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst.

### [12] [Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. III. Comparison between Starspot Mapping, Zeeman Doppler Imaging, and Multiwavelength Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15979)

TL;DR: Multi-wavelength analysis of star EK Dra reveals connections between starspots, magnetic fields, and prominence eruptions, with Hα variability linked to chromospheric activity around spots while X-rays show more complex coronal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between starspots, magnetic fields, and multi-wavelength variability in the young solar-type star EK Dra, particularly in the context of observed prominence eruptions and superflares, and to understand how these phenomena connect across different atmospheric layers.

Method: Performed starspot mapping using TESS photometry data, compared with Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) magnetic field maps, and analyzed multi-wavelength rotational variability across TESS optical, B-band, Hα, and X-ray light curves to study connections between photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal activity.

Result: (1) Spot locations from TESS light curves mostly match ZDI intensity maps except for polar spots; (2) Hα light curves show clear periodicity correlated with TESS variability, indicating chromospheric emission around spots; (3) X-ray light curves lack clear correlation due to multiple spots and extended coronal structures; (4) Results provide insights into flare associations across atmospheric layers.

Conclusion: The study successfully connects photospheric starspots with chromospheric Hα emission, revealing structured atmospheric activity in EK Dra, while X-ray variability reflects more complex coronal structures. These findings enable better quantification of stellar XUV radiation for understanding exoplanet atmospheric evolution and provide a framework for studying flare associations across different atmospheric heights.

Abstract: Recent simultaneous multiwavelength observations of a nearby young solar-type star EK Dra in the optical, H$α$ spectrum, and X-ray, have provided evidence for stellar prominence eruptions associated with superflares. The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$α$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$α$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$α$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets.

### [13] [Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars: Convection, Mass Loss, Nucleosynthesis, and Neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16082)
*Thiago Ferreira,Earl P. Bellinger,Ebraheem Farag,Christopher J. Lindsay*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: This paper presents hydrodynamic models of low-mass Population III stars (0.7-1 M☉) evolved to white dwarf phase using MESA, exploring how uncertain physics affects nucleosynthesis, surface enrichment, remnant properties, and observational signatures to identify surviving Pop III stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-mass Population III stars are particularly interesting because their long lifespans mean some could survive to the present day in the Milky Way's halo or satellite dwarfs. However, identifying these first stars and their descendants requires understanding how uncertain stellar physics affects their evolution and observable properties.

Method: The authors use the MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) software instrument to create hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7-1 M☉ Population III stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase. They systematically vary key uncertain physics parameters including mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport mechanisms, and overshooting prescriptions.

Result: The models reveal: 1) How uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields and surface enrichment (including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars from convective shell mergers), 2) Remnant properties such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 M☉) with transient UV-bright phases, and 3) Potential observational signatures including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes.

Conclusion: These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Population III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored. This represents the first paper in a series aimed at detecting these primordial stars in the Milky Way's halo and satellite systems.

Abstract: The first stars likely formed from pristine clouds, marking a transformative epoch after the dark ages by initiating reionisation and synthesising the first heavy elements. Among these, low-mass Population III stars are of particular interest, as their long lifespans raise the possibility that some may survive to the present day in the Milky Way's stellar halo or satellite dwarfs. As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored.

### [14] [Investigating Ionospheric TEC Variations in Solar and Geomagnetic Influences Across Solar Activity Phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16139)
*Ziyadat Hassan,Zamri Zainal Abidin,Affan Adly Nazri,Nursyazela Badrina Baharin*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of VTEC variability across solar cycles 23-25 reveals solar proxies (F10.7, sunspot number) show strongest correlations with ~2-day lag, while geomagnetic indices have weaker, phase-dependent effects, emphasizing need for phase-aware ionospheric models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite known solar radiation effects on VTEC, there's insufficient understanding of how relationships and time-lags vary across different solar cycle phases and cycles of varying intensity, creating a gap in comprehensive ionospheric modeling.

Method: Used global VTEC data from CASG and solar-geophysical indices from NASA OMNI dataset (1998-2025) to quantify correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and solar/geomagnetic parameters including F10.7 flux, sunspot number, Kp, Ap, Dst indices, and solar wind properties.

Result: Solar proxies (F10.7 and sunspot number) show strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during ascending/descending solar cycle phases with ~2-day lag. Geomagnetic indices have weaker, phase-dependent correlations. Solar wind parameters show weak direct correlations with global VTEC. Geomagnetic activity is more prominent during transitional phases.

Conclusion: Ionospheric modeling and forecasting must incorporate solar phase dependencies and time-lag considerations, as relationships between VTEC and drivers vary significantly across different solar cycle phases and require phase-aware parameterization.

Abstract: This study examines the variability of ionospheric total electron content (VTEC) in response to solar and geomagnetic drivers across solar cycles 23 to 25. While the dominant effect of solar radiation on VTEC is well-known, a comprehensive understanding of how these relationships and their time-lags vary across distinct solar cycle phases and across cycles of differing intensity has been lacking. Using global VTEC data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Global Ionospheric Maps (CASG) and solar-geophysical indices from NASA's OMNI dataset spanning from 1998 to 2025, this study bridges that gap by quantifying correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and parameters such as $F_{10.7}$ solar flux, R sunspot number, Kp, Ap, and Dst indices, and solar wind properties. Results show that solar proxies, particularly $F_{10.7}$ and R sunspot number, exhibit the strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, with a characteristic $\sim2$-day lag attributed to thermospheric oxygen dynamics and ionospheric recombination processes. In contrast, geomagnetic indices exhibit weaker and phase-dependent correlations, while direct correlations between solar wind parameters and global VTEC are weak, as their influence is primarily mediated by geomagnetic activity and exhibits strong regional and temporal heterogeneity. Phase-resolved analyses further reveal that geomagnetic activity plays a more prominent role during transitional phases, while maximum and minimum periods are dominated by EUV variability and non-solar drivers, respectively. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating solar phase and time-lag dependencies in ionospheric modelling and forecasting efforts.

### [15] [Reinterpreting the sunward electron deficit: Implications for solar wind acceleration and core population formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16221)
*Zoltan Nemeth*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper re-evaluates the relationship between observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the Sun's electrostatic potential, proposing that local magnetic mirror traps formed by interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations explain the electron deficit, with cutoff energy reflecting only local trap potential rather than the full solar potential well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-evaluate whether observed sunward electron cutoff energy truly reflects the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential, and to investigate if local magnetic traps formed by interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations provide an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit.

Method: First-principles calculations following electron motion outward against solar electrostatic potential while interacting with moving magnetic mirror traps formed by interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations; derivation of mathematical expression for cutoff velocity beyond which particles cannot overtake trap endpoints.

Result: Observed cutoff energy characterizes only local potential drop within traps, not total depth of Sun's potential well; true potential can be significantly deeper, scaled by ratio of radial distance to trap size; electrons captured by moving traps contribute to solar wind core population.

Conclusion: Sun's electrostatic potential is more significant in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data; interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides new framework for understanding solar wind core electron origin and behavior.

Abstract: This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.

*Alexander Holas,Veronica Agaeva,Friedrich K. Roepke,Samuel W. Jones,Javier Moran-Fraile,Marco Vetter,Rüdiger Pakmor,Philipp Podsiadlowski*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 3D MHD simulation of He-CO WD merger shows low ¹⁶O/¹⁸O ratios (~1) can be sustained for up to 100 years in outer burning regions via ¹⁴C(α,γ)¹⁸O channel, explaining RCB star oxygen isotope anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCB stars show extremely low ¹⁶O/¹⁸O ratios, but it's unclear if WD merger remnants can maintain such ratios for the predicted ~10⁴ year RCB lifetimes.

Method: Detailed nucleosynthesis calculations based on 3D MHD simulation of 0.3 M☉ He WD + 0.6 M☉ CO WD merger, following radial zones for long-term evolution up to 100 years.

Result: Asymmetric merger imprints abundance distribution; ¹⁶O/¹⁸O ratios ~1 observed for up to 100 years; outer burning regions favor ¹⁴C(α,γ)¹⁸O channel over ¹⁴N(α,γ)¹⁸F(β⁺)¹⁸O, avoiding fast α-captures to ²²Ne.

Conclusion: WD merger remnants can achieve and sustain low ¹⁶O/¹⁸O ratios in outer layers via alternative nucleosynthesis pathways, supporting WD merger origin for RCB stars.

Abstract: The merger of a He white dwarf (WD) and a CO WD is the favored formation channel for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. These stars exhibit ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios that are orders of magnitude lower than the solar value. However, it is not fully understood whether such low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios can be achieved in WD merger remnants for the predicted lifetime of RCB stars of around $10^4\,\mathrm{years}$. In this work, we perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations of a 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a merger of a $0.3\,M_\odot$ He WD and a $0.6\,M_\odot$ CO WD for $4000\,\mathrm{s}$ at which point a steady state in temperature and density is reached. From this point, we follow several radial zones to study the long-term production of ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ and its variability throughout the burning region.
  We find that the asymmetric merger process leaves an imprint on the distribution of the abundances at the end of our hydrodynamic simulation. During the long-term evolution up to $100\,\mathrm{years}$, we observe ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios of order of unity, although the timescale on which ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ is destroyed again is highly location dependent. Importantly, our calculations suggest that in the outer layers of the burning shell, the dominant production channel is $^{14}\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ instead of the commonly considered $^{14}\mathrm{N}(α,γ)^{18}\mathrm{F}(β^+)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ reaction, whereby the former can be sustained for longer periods of time. Furthermore, these outer regions do not reach the conditions necessary for fast $α$-captures in ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ to ${^{22}}\mathrm{Ne}$, thus being favorable to maintaining a low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratio.

TL;DR: Analytic equations derived for protostellar disk accretion driven by a perpendicular magnetic field, including accretion speed, mass accretion rate, energy dissipation, timescales, and disk evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop analytic equations that describe how a static magnetic field perpendicular to a protostellar disk surface drives accretion by braking the disk, providing physical insight and a check for computational models of protostar and protostellar disk formation.

Method: Derivation of general analytic equations for accretion speed and mass accretion rate in a protostellar disk threaded by a perpendicular magnetic field, followed by simplified analytic equations for disk energy dissipation, accretion timescale, and temporal evolution of disk radial position and surface density.

Result: Complete set of analytic equations describing magnetic braking-driven accretion in protostellar disks, including both general and simplified formulations that capture the key physical processes and temporal evolution.

Conclusion: The derived analytic equations provide valuable physical insight into magnetically-driven protostellar disk accretion and serve as useful benchmarks for validating computational models of protostar and protostellar disk formation.

Abstract: A protostellar disk is threaded by a static magnetic field that is perpendicular to the disk-surface. The magnetic field acts to brake the protostellar disk and cause the disk material to move towards the protostar. General analytic equations are derived for the accretion speed, and mass accretion rate. Simplified analytic equations are also obtained for the disk energy dissipation, accretion timescale and the disk radial position plus disk surface density, as a function of time. In addition to providing physical insight, such equations might be useful as a check on computational models for protostar and protostellar disk formation.

### [18] [The role of radiative torques in the molecular cloud core L43](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16519)
*Marco Leon Scheiter,Sebastian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study uses multi-wavelength polarization observations of molecular cloud core L43 to investigate dust alignment mechanisms, finding evidence supporting radiative torque alignment and deriving magnetic field strengths from 13-60 μG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how anisotropic radiation fields influence dust grain alignment by magnetic fields (radiative torque alignment), which is crucial for accurate magnetic field inference from dust polarization observations.

Method: Analyzed polarization maps at 154 μm (SOFIA/HAWC+), 450 μm, and 850 μm (JCMT/SCUBA-2) of L43 molecular cloud core containing an embedded optically visible star. Applied differential measure analysis to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze global polarization spectrum.

Result: Derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from ~13 to 60 μG (varying with wavelength), found negative slope of polarization spectrum. Results indicate polarization degree depends on temperature/local radiation field strength, favoring radiative torques as primary alignment mechanism.

Conclusion: Radiative torque alignment is supported as the primary dust alignment mechanism, with polarization variations attributed to dust property/temperature variations along line of sight, though magnetic field orientation variations cannot be ruled out.

Abstract: Polarized emission from interstellar dust grains is commonly used to infer information about the underlying magnetic field from the diffuse interstellar medium to molecular cloud cores. Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 μ\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 μ\mathrm{m}$ and $850 μ\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $μ\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field.

*F. Figueroa-Tapia,J. A. Panei,M. Curé,I. Araya,S. Ekström,A. C. Gormaz-Matamala,R. O. J. Venero,L. S. Cidale*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Self-consistent modeling of O-star winds shows mass-loss rates decrease with more elements in radiation field due to UV flux reduction, with Bayesian-fitted prescriptions achieving high correlation (>0.92).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mass-loss rate predictions for O-type stars are essential for stellar evolution and population synthesis models, as radiation-driven winds significantly impact both stellar structure and interstellar medium feedback.

Method: Coupled hydrodynamics with detailed line acceleration calculations using TLUSTY for non-LTE atmosphere models, LOCUS for line-force parameters, and HYDWIND for wind hydrodynamics, applied across stellar parameter grids for three chemical configurations.

Result: Mass-loss rates systematically decrease with inclusion of more elements due to reduced UV flux contribution; Bayesian fitting yielded theoretical prescriptions with Pearson correlations >0.92 and wind momentum-luminosity relationships consistent with observations.

Conclusion: Self-consistent wind modeling reveals chemical composition significantly affects mass-loss rates through UV spectral energy distribution changes, providing improved theoretical prescriptions that align well with observational constraints.

Abstract: Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars.

TL;DR: Study identifies 439 white dwarf candidates in 117 open clusters using Gaia data, with 244 likely formed through binary evolution based on age discrepancies, revealing magnetic and rapidly rotating systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: White dwarfs formed through binary evolution offer insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics, but distinguishing them from single-star formed WDs is challenging.

Method: Used Gaia 5D astrometry to identify WD candidates in open clusters, compared WD ages from single-star evolution models to cluster ages to identify binary origin candidates, and performed spectroscopic observations.

Result: Identified 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution; spectroscopic observations revealed subsets with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation.

Conclusion: Age comparison between WD single-star evolutionary models and host cluster ages effectively identifies binary-origin WDs, revealing exotic systems that provide insights into binary evolution processes.

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), the evolutionary endpoints of most stars, can form through both single-star and binary channels. While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin.

TL;DR: PINN-based SFT modeling reveals nonlinear interplay between tilt and latitude quenching regulates polar field buildup and solar cycle modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how nonlinear feedbacks (tilt quenching and latitude quenching) regulate solar polar field regeneration and cycle amplitude, and to develop more accurate modeling tools.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) solving surface flux transport equation with embedded physical constraints, systematically varying transport parameters to isolate TQ and LQ contributions.

Result: TQ suppression strengthens with diffusivity, LQ dominates in advection regimes; ΔD_LQ/ΔD_TQ shows inverse-square dependence on dynamo effectivity range; PINN outperforms traditional 1D SFT with lower errors; nonlinear interplay produces alternations between weak/strong cycles.

Conclusion: PINN provides accurate, efficient, physically consistent solar cycle prediction tool; nonlinear LQ-TQ interplay explains even-odd cycle modulation; decay term unnecessary in PINN setup due to training process.

Abstract: The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for orbital motions in three close binary systems in Orion South to determine their masses and evolutionary stage.

Method: Used high-angular resolution (≈0.06") VLA and ALMA observations separated by 15.52 years to measure changes in position angles and separations of three close (≈0.1") binary systems.

Result: Detected significant changes in separation for two binaries (no position angle changes), estimating total masses of ≈1-2 M☉. Derived dust-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.04-0.18 from mm emission, consistent with Class 0 protostars.

Conclusion: The study successfully measured orbital motions to constrain binary masses and confirmed the systems are in very early evolutionary stages (Class 0 protostars) based on their dust-to-stellar mass ratios.

Abstract: We present high-angular resolution ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}06$) VLA and ALMA observations of Orion South separated by 15.52 years. The purpose of this study was to search for orbital motions in three close ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}1$) binary systems in the region. We do not detect changes in the position angle of the binaries but in two of the cases we detect significant changes in their separation in the plane of the sky. We use these changes to estimate that the total mass of the binaries is in the $\simeq$1-2 $M_\odot$ range. We also estimate the disk masses from the mm emission. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is in the range of 0.04 to 0.18, values consistent with those expected for very early stellar evolution (Class 0) protostars.
