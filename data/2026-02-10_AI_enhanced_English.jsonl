We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$). This immense mass disparity rules out the dynamical possibility of a rotating system. We demonstrate that the apparent optical bimodality arises from the projection of a filament, which led optical group-finding algorithms to misclassify these galaxies as cluster members.

Comments welcome", "summary": "PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre.

While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $\u03bd_\\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $\u03bd_\\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs.

The $\u03a3$-effect model of \\cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures.
