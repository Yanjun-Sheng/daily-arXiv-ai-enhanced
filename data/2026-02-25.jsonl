We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity."}

This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($ε_\\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \\simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \\ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \\lesssim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \\sim 0.1\\,M_\\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $ε_\\star \\approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \\simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation."}

To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/dν to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core."}

In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling."}

We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures."}

These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\\leq$1 MK is $\\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos."}

We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium."}

Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the \"streaming limit.\" Downstream, a spatially-uniform \"reservoir\" of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements. As samples of the corona, SEP abundances also probe differences with the photosphere that depend upon the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements."}

The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship."}

Gardner", "Antonio Napolitano"], "title": "Solar cycle irregularity study", "comment": "3 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo."}

However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection."}

To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($δ>\\sim0^{\\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $γ$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems."}

Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy."}

Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $β$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies -- sinusoidal and double-hump -- distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+β\\le 90^\\circ$ versus $i+β>90^\\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies."}

By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field. We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis.

Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $ν_{\\rm b} = 6.2\\pm1.3$ GHz.

Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset."}

Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin."}

Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay Δt between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and Δt. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN > 0.5 and RN > 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN > 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN > 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds.

Specifically, we aim to constrain the behavior of α-element enhancements with metallicity, the dependence of [α/Fe] on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the absorption-line velocity widths (Δv90) vs. stellar mass, Δv90 vs. metallicity, and mass-metallicity relations. For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [α/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with Δv90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [α/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy. We further find that the velocity widths vs. stellar masses and mass-metallicity relations agree well with observations, while GEAR should be calibrated more carefully to reproduce the Δv90 vs. metallicity relation."}

In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere.

In total intensity, J022248\\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity.

We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \\pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\\pm0.19$ dex).

Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars.

We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity."}

They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \\textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \\leq m/M \\leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis."}

To better understand the formation of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, we characterize the chemical and kinematic properties of halo substructures using GALAH DR4 and Gaia data. We apply wavelet transforms in the space of sqrt(J_r) and azimuthal action (L_z) to identify kinematic overdensities. Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin."}

CRs can dissociate the molecules on dust grains, producing reactive suprathermal species and radicals which facilitate the formation of large molecules. We add the radiolysis process and some relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $ζ\\lesssim 10^{-14}\\ \\rm s^{-1}$. The non-diffusive chemistry affects the simulation results at 16 K but not 77K, while the results are sensitive to the desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77 K. Our results show that the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 in experiments can be reproduced by fine-tuning the chemical model, but still call for more constraints on the intermediate pathways in the radiolysis processes, especially the ion chemistry in the ice bulk, as well as activation barriers and branching ratios of the reactions in the network."}

We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\\pm0.116 and 0.733\\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\\pm0.110 and 0.529\\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751\\pm0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442\\pm0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs."}

Submitted to A&A: accepted for publication after minor revision", "summary": "Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}>50\\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \\gtrsim 10^{46}\\,{erg\\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN."}

Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \\pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures."}

This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries.

We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \\textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \\textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \\textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\\sim13\\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries.
