Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: X-ray-based measurement of the brightest central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation spanning 10¹²-10¹⁵ M☉ reveals peak stellar fraction at ~10¹² M☉, declining at higher masses due to feedback and assembly processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation remain limited, especially for low-mass groups, creating uncertainties in understanding how galaxies assemble stars across different halo mass scales. Accurate measurement of the BCG stellar-to-halo mass relation over a wide mass range is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and feedback processes.

Method: Used eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data to derive halo masses and SDSS photometry for BCG stellar masses. Stacked X-ray spectra of optically selected groups to recover robust average halo gas temperatures, then converted to halo masses via the M-T_X relation. Covered halo masses from 10¹² to 10¹⁵ M☉.

Result: The stellar-to-halo mass relation peaks near M_halo ~ 10¹² M☉, with declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This reflects reduced efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos due to AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and increasing ex-situ assembly dominance. Results are consistent with previous observational studies across the full mass range. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but significant normalization discrepancies at cluster scales.

Conclusion: Provides the first X-ray-based observational stellar-to-halo mass relation covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establishing a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models. Highlights sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history in simulations.

Abstract: The stellar content of galaxies is tightly connected to the mass and growth of their host dark matter halos. Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\,M_\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models.

TL;DR: A homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of 22,339 stars across 78 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites and globular clusters, obtained with Keck/DEIMOS, featuring improved radial velocity and metallicity measurements with enhanced precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a uniform, high-quality spectroscopic dataset for Milky Way satellite systems to enable consistent analysis and comparison across diverse systems, addressing limitations of heterogeneous literature data.

Method: Used Keck II telescope with DEIMOS spectrograph (1200G grating, R~6000); reduced 411 masks with PypeIt for sky subtraction; developed dmost forward modeling method combining synthetic telluric and stellar templates for radial velocities; derived [Fe/H] from equivalent widths.

Result: Catalog of 22,339 stars with radial velocities, [Fe/H] metallicities, and membership estimates; achieved velocity error floor of 1.1 km/s and metallicity error floor of 0.1 dex; demonstrated 20-50% improved precision in velocity dispersions compared to literature.

Conclusion: The homogeneous dataset provides significantly improved precision for studying Milky Way satellite properties, with applications in companion papers and public data release enabling further astrophysical studies.

Abstract: We present a homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of 22,339 stars in 78 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites and globular clusters. All data were taken with the Keck II telescope and Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multiobject Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectrograph using the 1200G grating (spectral resolution R~6000). Based on a uniform data reduction of 411 DEIMOS masks, we present a catalog of individual stellar radial velocities, equivalent width-based [Fe/H] metallicities, and membership estimates. The Milky Way satellites range from M_V = 2 to -14 (M* = 10^1.5 to 10^7.5 Msun); the majority of individual stars presented in these systems have magnitudes 17 > r > 22. The data were reduced to 1D spectra using PypeIt, which provides near Poisson statistics-level sky subtraction. Radial velocities were determined via dmost, a forward modeling method first presented here, which combines both synthetic telluric and stellar templates to determine stellar radial velocities. We assess the accuracy and precision our method via comparison to thousands of repeat measurements and literature values. We determine a velocity error floor of 1.1 km/s and a CaII triplet-based metallicity error floor of 0.1 dex. We calculate internal velocity dispersions and compare to literature values, demonstrating 20-50% improved precision over the literature in most cases. In a companion paper, we use our homogeneous catalogs to explore properties of these Milky Way satellites, including previously unpublished measurements in several systems including Bootes II and Draco II. We provide full access to the data catalogs to enable further studies.

*Marla Geha*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Homogeneous re-analysis of Keck/DEIMOS spectra for 67 Milky Way systems reveals clear separation between satellite galaxies and globular clusters in dynamical properties, identifies break in stellar mass-metallicity relation at log M*/Msun = 4, and provides uniform measurements for improved dark matter constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous population-level studies of Milky Way satellites rely on heterogeneous spectroscopic analyses with systematic differences between pipelines and membership criteria that can masquerade as astrophysical signals or obscure real trends.

Method: Homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph for 67 Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters with ≥10 member stars, determining enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions.

Result: Satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios at given stellar mass. Break in stellar mass-metallicity relation at log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V ~ -4.5): above this mass, tight trend of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass (0.16 dex scatter); below, relation flattens/increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies show internal metallicity scatter of 0.3-0.4 dex across stellar mass range. Average enclosed mass densities agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions.

Conclusion: Uniform measurements enable tighter constraints on stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and provide foundation for interpreting new Milky Way satellites expected from LSST/Roman/Euclid era.

Abstract: Population-level studies of Milky Way satellites used to constrain dark matter or the threshold of galaxy formation often rely on velocity dispersions and metallicities derived from heterogeneous spectroscopic analyses. Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V ~ -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper presents a galaxy catalog for the Fornax cluster region using S-PLUS survey data, employing deep learning for object classification and machine learning for photometric redshifts and galaxy properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive galaxy catalog in the Fornax cluster region for large-scale structure studies, enabling cosmological investigations and constraints on galaxy formation models through wide-field multi-band observations.

Method: Combined SExtractor configurations for galaxy detection, supervised deep learning with neural networks and dimensionality reduction for object classification (spurious objects, stars, galaxies), and machine learning approaches for photometric redshifts, stellar masses, SFRs, and D4000_N index estimation by matching S-PLUS data to SDSS spectroscopic data.

Result: Produced a catalog of 119,580 galaxies in the Fornax direction with 12 optical bands plus UV, NIR, and MIR data; achieved photometric redshift accuracy σ_NMAD ~ 0.0219 with z_lim ~ 0.03; catalog completeness of 72% validated against mock catalogs.

Conclusion: The catalog enables unprecedented large-scale structure studies in the Fornax region, providing a valuable resource for cosmological analyses and galaxy evolution studies through comprehensive multi-wavelength photometric data and machine learning-derived properties.

Abstract: Observational extragalactic catalogs over wide sky areas are essential for uncovering the large-scale structure of the Universe. They allow, among others, cosmological studies and density analyses that impose strong constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. By taking advantage of the wide field images and the 12 optical bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), we aim at providing a catalog of galaxies located, in projection, towards the Fornax galaxy cluster, within $\sim$ 5 virial radii in right ascension (R.A.) and $\sim$ 3 virial radius in declination (Dec) around NGC,1399, the dominant galaxy of the cluster. Such a catalog will allow unprecedented large-scale structure studies in that sky region. Supervised deep learning algorithms have been developed, utilizing neural networks complemented with dimensionality reduction techniques, to classify and separate spurious objects, stars and galaxies in a photometric catalog previously built for the S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP). That catalog was built using a combination of SExtractor configurations optimized for galaxy detection and characterization. A catalog of 119,580 galaxies was obtained in the direction of the Fornax cluster containing photometric information in the 12 optical bands of S-PLUS complemented with GALEX (UV), VHS-VISTA (NIR) and AllWISE (MIR) data. We estimate photometric redshifts (σ_ NMAD $\sim$ 0.0219) with a lower limit of z_ lim $\sim$ 0.03. Stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs) and D4000_N index estimates were obtained through a machine learning approach, by matching S-PLUS photometric data to SDSS spectroscopic data. The completeness of the catalog (72%) was calculated by comparing with mock catalogs ...

### [5] [Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Star Candidates in the Milky Way from J-PLUS and S-PLUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10325)
*Jihye Hong,Timothy C. Beers,Yang Huang,Jonathan Cabrera Garcia,Young Sun Lee,Vinicius M. Placco,Evan N. Kirby*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: J-PLUS and S-PLUS photometric surveys identify ~104,900 carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, confirming photometric separation into CEMP-no and CEMP-s groups and recovering all known morphological groups including the recently proposed Group IV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale photometric surveys now enable elemental-abundance estimates approaching spectroscopic accuracy, providing opportunities to identify and study large samples of rare stellar populations like CEMP stars across extensive sky coverage.

Method: Used [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] estimates from J-PLUS DR3 and S-PLUS DR4 covering ~6,200 deg², applied data-quality cuts and evolutionary corrections to carbon abundances, constructed combined sample of ~6.40 million stars, and identified CEMP candidates through photometric analysis.

Result: Identified ~104,900 CEMP candidates (twice the number from Gaia XP spectra), photometrically confirmed separation into CEMP-no and CEMP-s groups, recovered all morphological groups (I-IV), showed Group IV is statistically distinct, and demonstrated CEMP fraction increases toward lower metallicity with CEMP-no dominating at lowest metallicities.

Conclusion: The catalog provides a substantial sample for spectroscopic follow-up to constrain the origin of Group IV stars, demonstrating photometric surveys can effectively identify and characterize CEMP populations across different Galactic components.

Abstract: Recent large-scale multi-band photometric surveys now enable elemental-abundance estimates for millions of stars with accuracies approaching those of low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy. Using [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] estimates derived from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4, which together cover $\sim$6,200 deg$^2$ of the sky, we identify large numbers of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Milky Way. After applying data-quality cuts and evolutionary corrections to the carbon-abundance estimates, we construct a combined J/S-PLUS sample of $\sim$6.40 million stars and identify $\sim$104,900 CEMP candidates, roughly twice the number of CEMP candidates identified from Gaia XP spectra by Lucey et al. We photometrically confirm that the absolute carbon abundance $A$(C) separates CEMP stars into two primary groups, CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, consistent with previous spectroscopic studies. We also recover CEMP morphological Groups I-III in the Yoon-Beers diagram, as well as the recently proposed Group IV, and show that it is statistically distinct even in photometric data. A cumulative frequency analysis confirms that the CEMP fraction increases toward lower metallicity and that CEMP-no stars dominate in the most metal-poor regime. By comparing frequencies with and without Group IV stars, we assess their relation to CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, and examine CEMP distributions across different Galactic components. The resulting catalog provides a substantial sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, in particular to constrain the likely origin(s) of the Group IV stars.

### [6] [MAGNUS III: Mild evolution of the total density slope in massive early-type galaxies since z$\sim$1 from dynamical modeling of MUSE integral-field stellar kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10347)
*Pritom Mozumdar,Michele Cappellari,Christopher D. Fassnacht,Tommaso Treu*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Massive early-type galaxies show shallower total density slopes at intermediate redshifts (z~0.44) compared to local counterparts, indicating structural evolution over cosmic time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the evolution of total mass density slopes in massive early-type galaxies over the last 6.5 billion years (0<z<0.75) and understand structural changes in galaxy assembly.

Method: Combined dynamical analysis of ~200 ETGs at 0.24<z<0.75 using MUSE-DEEP spectroscopy and HST imaging with Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE), compared to local MaNGA sample analyzed with identical methodology.

Result: Intermediate-redshift ETGs have shallower median mass-weighted total density slope (γ_T=2.19±0.01 at z=0.44) than local baseline (γ_T=2.26±0.01 at z=0.04), with significant redshift gradient dγ_T/dz≈-0.20±0.03 detected at ~5σ significance.

Conclusion: The observed steepening of density profiles suggests dissipative processes (gas-rich accretion and mergers) play significant role in late-stage assembly of massive ETGs, consistent with lensing studies but in tension with cosmological simulations.

Abstract: We investigate the total mass density slope evolution in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) over the last 6.5 billion years ($0 < z < 0.75$). We perform a detailed dynamical analysis of approximately 200 ETGs spanning the redshift range $0.24 < z < 0.75$, utilizing spatially resolved stellar kinematics derived from high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) MUSE-DEEP spectroscopy and surface brightness models from high-resolution HST imaging. We constrain mass distributions using the Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) technique coupled with Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) method. To rigorously constrain evolutionary trends, we combine this intermediate-redshift dataset with a local ETG sample ($z \sim 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. We adopt dynamical constraints for the local sample derived using an identical homogeneous methodology, ensuring a strictly consistent comparison. We found that the total density profiles of the intermediate-redshift ETG sample are approximately isothermal and exhibit a median mass-weighted total density slope, $<γ_{\rm T}>=2.19 \pm 0.01$ at $<z>=0.44$, which is shallower than the local baseline of $<γ_{\rm T}> = 2.26 \pm 0.01$ at $<z>=0.04$. This structural shift corresponds to a redshift gradient of $\mathrm{d} γ_{\rm T}/\mathrm{d} z \approx -0.20 \pm 0.03$, detected at $\sim$5-$σ$ significance. We demonstrate that this trend is robust against model assumptions and persists even when restricting the analysis to high-velocity dispersion systems ($σ_e > 150$ km/s). Our findings are consistent with previous lensing-based studies and in tension with cosmological simulations. The observed steepening suggests that dissipative processes, such as gas-rich accretion and mergers, must play a non-negligible role in the late-stage assembly of massive ETGs.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Study of cosmic-ray electron transport and galactic wind in edge-on galaxy NGC 3044 using high-sensitivity ASKAP radio observations, revealing two-component exponential halo structure and evidence for cosmic-ray-driven winds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge-on star-forming galaxies show extended halo radiation, making them ideal for studying matter transport from disk to halo. The paper aims to investigate cosmic-ray electron transport, associated galactic winds, and their impact on the surrounding medium in NGC 3044.

Method: Used Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations at 943 MHz with 16 arcsec resolution and 20 μJy beam⁻¹ sensitivity. Analyzed total intensity and spectral index profiles perpendicular to the disk. Applied one-dimensional advection and diffusion models to jointly fit intensity and spectral index profiles. Combined radio data with multi-wavelength observations (X-ray, HI, Hα) to identify structures.

Result: ASKAP intensity profiles show two exponential components: thin disk scale height = 0.43 ± 0.13 kpc, thick disk scale height = 1.91 ± 0.26 kpc. Cosmic-ray electrons are advected outward with velocity increasing with height in a power law. Beyond ~3 kpc, velocity exceeds escape speed (~400 km s⁻¹), indicating strong wind. Identified a possible superbubble of radius ~3 kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas, surrounded by HI shell and bright Hα rim.

Conclusion: Radio continuum observations provide a powerful probe of cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies. The study demonstrates that cosmic-ray electrons are transported via advection with increasing velocity, leading to strong galactic winds that can escape the galaxy, and reveals multi-phase structures (X-ray, HI, Hα) associated with these outflows.

Abstract: Star-forming edge-on galaxies often exhibit extended halo radiation in multiple bands, providing ideal laboratories for studying the transfer of matter from the disk to the halo. We investigate the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and the associated galactic wind, and assess their impact on the surrounding medium in NGC 3044. We obtained the NGC 3044 total intensity image at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with a resolution of 16 arcsec and an rms noise of 20 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The sensitivity is higher than the previous observations at similar frequencies. We find that the ASKAP intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk can be fit with two exponential components. The scale heights of the thin and thick disks are $0.43 \pm 0.13$ kpc and $1.91 \pm 0.26$ kpc, respectively. By jointly fitting total intensity and spectral index profiles with one-dimensional advection and diffusion models, we find that CREs are advected outward from the disk with the velocity increasing with height in a power law. Beyond $\sim3$ kpc, the velocity exceeds the escape speed of $\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a strong wind. We further identify a possible superbubble of radius $\sim3$ kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright H$α$ rim. These results demonstrate that radio continuum observations provide a powerful probe of cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies.

TL;DR: Identification and orbital analysis of 289 very metal-poor red giant stars from APOGEE survey using calibrated parameters and null metallicity values as signatures of extreme metal deficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify stars observed by APOGEE survey that fall below the survey's metallicity analysis limit, addressing challenges in analyzing metal-poor star spectra due to limited spectral lines and potential misclassification.

Method: Used calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters with null metallicity values as indicators of extreme metal deficiency, combined with APOGEE radial velocities, Gaia DR3 astrometry, and spectrophotometric distances to compute orbital properties for classification.

Result: Identified 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely [Fe/H] < -2.5), including 16 Magellanic Cloud member candidates, 14 stars with inner Galaxy orbits, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers, with high confidence for stars in 3700-6700 K range and S/N > 30.

Conclusion: Null metallicity values in APOGEE calibrated parameters reliably indicate very metal-poor stars, enabling identification of interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up and revealing diverse orbital populations including Magellanic Cloud members and inner Galaxy stars.

Abstract: In the search for metal-poor stars, large spectroscopic surveys are an invaluable tool. However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N > 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers.

TL;DR: Researchers developed a specialized pipeline to measure metallicities for 327 very metal-poor stars using Mg and Si abundances from APOGEE H-band spectra, overcoming limitations of standard pipelines for extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.5).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard APOGEE pipeline fails to properly analyze very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2) because Fe lines in H-band spectra are too weak, leaving these stars with null metallicity values despite their scientific importance for understanding early galactic chemical evolution.

Method: Developed specialized pipeline to measure Mg and Si abundances from APOGEE H-band spectra, tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement, and used these abundances to derive overall metallicities for 327 previously unanalyzed metal-poor stars.

Result: Successfully measured metallicities for 327 stars with typical uncertainties of 0.2 dex, extending APOGEE's metal-poor tail down to [M/H] = -3.1 (0.6 dex improvement). Identified 5 stars with unusual [Si/Mg] > 0.5, suggesting connection to globular cluster stars and specific supernova events, with concentration in Sextans dwarf galaxy.

Conclusion: Mg and Si lines in H-band spectra provide reliable metallicity measurements for extremely metal-poor stars where Fe lines fail, enabling analysis of previously inaccessible populations and revealing chemical signatures potentially linked to specific nucleosynthetic events in early galaxy formation.

Abstract: H-band spectra contain very limited spectral information for stars at the most metal-poor tail ( Fe/H < -2.5) because the available Fe lines in FGK stars in this wavelength range are weak. The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\leq$ [M/H] $\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Benchmark study comparing PCA, ICA, wavelet-based iterative soft thresholding (IST), and 3D U-Net for denoising faint ALMA spectral cubes; finds IST robust for moderate-SNR data while U-Net performs best on synthetic data but faces generalization challenges with complex real-world morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faint galaxy signals beyond cosmic noon are crucial for understanding massive galaxy assembly, but ALMA observations suffer from noise that requires robust denoising techniques to extract meaningful information about interstellar medium properties.

Method: Evaluated four denoising strategies: PCA, ICA, iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets (IST), and supervised deep learning with 3D U-Net. Applied to three datasets: (1) synthetic rotating toy disk galaxies, (2) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (3) real ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526.

Result: For synthetic cubes: PCA/ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but suppresses emission at low SNRs; U-Net outperforms IST but produces hallucinations at lower SNRs. For moderate-SNR ALMA-CRISTAL data: U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance (>91% flux conservation, >6× SNR improvement). For complex morphology W2246: U-Net underperforms (~80% flux recovery) while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3×.

Conclusion: IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, while synthetically trained U-Net generalizes effectively to real data but depends heavily on training priors. The framework provides transferable denoising solutions for ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and JWST observations.

Abstract: Beyond cosmic noon, galaxies appear as faint whispers amid noise, yet this epoch is key to understanding massive galaxy assembly. ALMA's sensitivity to cold dust and [C II] emission allows us to probe their interstellar medium, but faint signals make robust denoising essential. We evaluate and benchmark denoising strategies including Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, sparse unsupervised representations: iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets, and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, to identify techniques that suppress noise while preserving flux and morphology across peak SNRs of 2.5-8, applied to (i) synthetic spectral cubes of rotating toy disk galaxies, (ii) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (iii) ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526. Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving >91% flux and increasing SNR by >6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors. This framework offers a pathway for transferable denoising for ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and JWST.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of 89 strong lenses from AGEL survey shows most deflectors are in cluster environments (47.2%) but few have cluster-scale Einstein masses (9.0%), revealing weak correlation between Einstein mass and environment density, suggesting single-galaxy lens modeling is oversimplified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deflector environments in strong lensing systems affect cosmological model testing and galaxy evolution constraints, and to quantify the relationship between deflector scale (Einstein mass) and environment (halo mass).

Method: Analyzed 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses from AGEL survey: measured deflector scale via Einstein radius θ_E to determine Einstein mass M(<θ_E); quantified environment using photometric redshifts to calculate galaxy surface density Σ_5(z) to fifth-nearest neighbor; compared number densities between AGEL and control fields.

Result: 47.2% of deflectors in cluster environments but only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein masses; weak correlation (r=0.38) between Einstein mass and Σ_5(z); AGEL deflectors in systematically denser environments than control fields; provides method to identify lenses by environment and approximate large-scale environment impact.

Conclusion: The assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly simplified; weak correlation suggests observational biases and detection challenges; study provides framework for incorporating environmental effects in strong lensing analyses.

Abstract: The environments of deflectors in strong lensing systems affect our ability to test cosmological models and constrain evolutionary properties of galaxies. Here we measure the deflector scale (Einstein mass) and deflector environment (halo mass) of 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses in the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution With Lenses (AGEL) survey. We classify deflector scale by measuring $θ_{\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(<θ_{\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $Σ_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $Σ_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments. Our study provides a method to identify strong lenses as a function of deflector environment and approximate the impact of large-scale environment in lens modeling. We provide the measured lensing parameters for our 89 AGEL systems as well as $z_{\rm{phot}}$ and $r$-mag (AB) maps of the line-of-sight.

### [12] [A method for constructing the joint mass function of binary stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10186)
*Amery Gration,Robert G. Izzard,Payel Das*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A method for constructing the joint distribution of primary and secondary star masses in binary systems, going beyond the known random pairing case to handle general pairing mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The initial mass function (IMF) is fundamental but incomplete for binary systems, which constitute most stars. A full statistical description requires the joint distribution of primary and secondary masses, which respects both the IMF and the pairing mechanism, but this distribution is only known for random pairing.

Method: The authors present a general method for constructing the joint distribution of primary and secondary star masses in binary populations. The method accounts for both the underlying IMF and the specific pairing mechanism that assembles binaries from the stellar population.

Result: The method successfully recovers the known result for random pairing and derives the previously unknown result for uniform pairing, demonstrating its capability to handle different pairing mechanisms.

Conclusion: The developed method provides a general framework for constructing the joint mass distribution in binary systems, enabling more complete statistical descriptions of stellar populations beyond the limitations of the IMF alone.

Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly born stars and is amongst the most fundamental concepts in astrophysics. It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing.

*Veome Kapil,Ilya Mandel,Evgeni Grishin,Jim Fuller,Jeff Riley,Emanuele Berti*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Updated tidal dissipation prescriptions for rapid binary population synthesis that encode stellar structure, stratification, and frequency dependence while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop simplified yet physically motivated tidal dissipation expressions suitable for rapid binary population synthesis codes, addressing limitations of commonly used prescriptions that lack explicit dependence on stellar structure and stratification.

Method: Develop simplified tidal dissipation expressions encoding stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency dependence; implement in COMPAS population synthesis code; demonstrate self-consistent coupling with stellar evolution and binary properties.

Result: New prescriptions show equilibrium tides 1-2 orders stronger for low-mass main sequence and giant stars, dynamical tides 1-7 orders stronger due to explicit stellar structure dependence and inertial wave dissipation; models agree with detailed simulations within an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The updated prescriptions provide physically motivated, computationally efficient tidal dissipation models for population synthesis that capture essential physics while maintaining agreement with detailed simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.

### [14] [The Landscape of Unstable Mass Transfer in Interacting Binaries and Its Imprint on the Population of Luminous Red Novae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10211)
*Angela A. G. Twum,Alejandro Vigna-Gómez,Morgan MacLeod,Rosa Wallace Everson,Ricardo Yarza,V. Ashley Villar,Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Binary population synthesis reveals bimodal plateau luminosity distribution in Luminous Red Novae from common-envelope interactions, with models underpredicting long-duration events by ~30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape common-envelope outcomes and enable predictive modeling of Luminous Red Novae luminosity functions.

Method: Combined binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to estimate mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations.

Result: Found bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria; models broadly match existing observations but underpredict long-duration plateaus (t_p ≳ 100 d) by about one-third; identified that long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors with non-impulsive envelope ejection.

Conclusion: Common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes including Thorne-Żytków-like objects and calcium-rich supernovae with hydrogen envelopes; models can clarify physical processes driving unstable mass transfer when combined with progenitor imaging constraints.

Abstract: A common-envelope (CE) phase occurs when a star engulfs its companion and is widely considered the primary channel for producing Luminous Red Novae (LRNe). In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \gtrsim 100\, \text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-Żytków objects (TŻOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes.

### [15] [Linking Solar Magnetism, Extreme Solar Particle Events and Stellar Superflares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10243)
*Valeriy Vasilyev,Natalie Krivova,Ilya Usoskin*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper examines the relationship between extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) inferred from cosmogenic isotopes and superflares observed on Sun-like stars, exploring whether these phenomena are physically related and what mechanisms might link them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between extreme solar particle events recorded in natural archives and superflares observed on Sun-like stars, and to determine whether these represent different manifestations of the same underlying physical processes or distinct phenomena.

Method: The paper synthesizes evidence from two complementary lines of research: 1) analysis of cosmogenic isotope concentrations in tree rings and ice cores over 15 millennia to infer ESPEs, and 2) high-precision space-borne photometry revealing superflares on Sun-like stars. The authors discuss physical mechanisms linking these phenomena.

Result: The relationship between superflares and ESPEs does not appear to be one-to-one. Both represent extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, but their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration.

Conclusion: While superflares and ESPEs share common physical origins in magnetic energy release, they are not directly equivalent phenomena. Their relationship is complex and depends on how magnetic field configurations influence energy partitioning between different forms of solar/stellar activity.

Abstract: The magnetic field of the Sun drives a wide range of eruptive phenomena, from small-scale nanoflares to large flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While direct observations of solar activity cover only the past few decades, indirect evidence indicates that the Sun can occasionally produce events orders of magnitude stronger than any recorded ones in the modern era. Two complementary lines of evidence exist. First, extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) have been inferred from prominent spikes in cosmogenic isotope concentrations preserved in precisely dated natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores over the past 15 millennia. Second, high-precision space-borne photometry has revealed superflares on thousands of stars similar to the Sun. Whether these solar and stellar extremes are physically related remains an open question. We summarise the present state of understanding and discuss physical mechanisms that may link them. Although superflares and ESPEs are both extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, their relationship does not appear to be one-to-one. Their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: PSP observations show distinct radial evolution of solar wind properties near the Sun, with temperature tensor components behaving differently: T⊥ decreases monotonically while T∥ shows non-monotonic trend, interpreted as proxy for proton beam occurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing plasma state in near-Sun environment is essential to constrain mechanisms that heat and accelerate solar wind, requiring detailed radial evolution analysis of solar wind properties using PSP observations.

Method: Used Parker Solar Probe observations from Encounters 1-24 with high field-of-view (>85%) coverage to derive radial profiles of magnetic field strength, proton density, bulk speed, temperature tensor components, temperature anisotropy, plasma beta, Alfvén Mach number, and magnetic field fluctuations for sub- and super-Alfvénic regions.

Result: In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law relationships of |B|, N, V, T with heliocentric distance consistent with previous Helios results. T⊥ decreases monotonically with distance, while T∥ shows non-monotonic trend - decreasing in sub-Alfvénic region then increasing just beyond Alfvén surface. Magnetic field fluctuations show decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction.

Conclusion: The increase in T∥ beyond Alfvén surface is interpreted as proxy for proton beam occurrence. Enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions, offering insights into solar wind heating and acceleration mechanisms.

Abstract: Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind. In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($>85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($β$), Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($δB/B$) for sub and super-Alfvénic regions. In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $>0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend -- decreasing in the sub-Alfvénic region, increasing just beyond the Alfvén surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.

### [17] [Evidence that SOL2012-06-03 Late Phase $γ$ Rays are Produced by $>$300 MeV Protons from CME-Shock Acceleration of Suprathermals from the Flare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10284)
*Gerald H. Share,Ronald J. Murphy*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper challenges the claim that SOL2012-06-03 was the first detection of two-phase >100 MeV gamma-ray emission, noting this phenomenon was first observed in SOL1982-06-03 as Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE). The authors provide evidence that the second gamma-ray peak in SOL2012-06-03 represents LPGRE onset lasting >8 minutes, with timing consistent with CME shock acceleration of flare-produced protons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct the historical record regarding two-phase high-energy gamma-ray emission in solar flares, specifically challenging the claim that SOL2012-06-03 was the first such detection. The authors aim to demonstrate that the second gamma-ray peak in SOL2012-06-03 represents Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE), a phenomenon cataloged in >40 solar eruptions since its first observation in SOL1982-06-03.

Method: The authors analyze timing relationships between gamma-ray emission phases, comparing the delay between impulsive X-ray peaks and subsequent gamma-ray emission. They examine the consistency of this delay with theoretical models of particle acceleration by CME shocks, specifically the time required for flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake an expanding CME. They also compare accelerated ion-to-electron ratios across different solar particle acceleration scenarios.

Result: The second gamma-ray peak in SOL2012-06-03 is identified as the onset of LPGRE lasting >8 minutes. The delay between the impulsive X-ray peak and this gamma-ray emission is consistent with the time required for flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events matches ratios observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks, distinguishing them from impulsive flares and reconnection-produced solar energetic particle events.

Conclusion: The two-phase >100 MeV gamma-ray emission in SOL2012-06-03 represents Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE), not a novel discovery. The timing and particle acceleration characteristics indicate that LPGRE results from CME shock acceleration of flare-produced protons, consistent with gradual SEP event mechanisms rather than impulsive flare processes. This places LPGRE events within the established framework of solar particle acceleration by CME-driven shocks.

Abstract: A recent paper on SOL2012-06-03 reported the detection for the first time of two distinct phases of $>$100 MeV $γ$-radiation indicating separate acceleration processes. But such two-phase emission has been seen before and was first observed in SOL1982-06-03. The second phase is known as Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE) and was cataloged for $>$40 solar eruptions, including SOL2012-06-03. Here we provide evidence that the second SOL2012-06-03 $π$-decay peak is the onset of LPGRE that lasted for $>$8 min. Its delay from the impulsive X-ray peak is consistent with the time it would take flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events is consistent with the ratio observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks and is inconsistent with ratios typically found in impulsive flares and solar energetic particle events produced by reconnection.

TL;DR: Analysis of Canis Major star-forming region using Gaia DR3 data identifies 1531 members (401 known + 1130 new), reveals two subgroups at ~1150-1183 pc distance with 2-3 Myr ages, and shows Cluster A has higher disk fraction suggesting younger age.

Motivation: The Canis Major region within the Radcliffe Wave is under-explored; the study aims to characterize its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent Gaia DR3 data to improve understanding of this remote star-forming region.

Method: Membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across 16 deg² field, combined with spectroscopic observations to investigate structure, kinematics, and age; uses astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3.

Result: Identified 1531 CMa members (401 confirmed + 1130 new candidates); discovered two subgroups (Cluster A and B) at similar distances (~1150-1183 pc) with similar space motions; mean isochronal age 2-3 Myr; Cluster A shows higher disk fraction suggesting younger age.

Conclusion: Study provides new insights into CMa stellar population, kinematics, and evolutionary stages; future Gaia releases, multi-wavelength, and high-resolution spectroscopic observations needed to advance understanding of star formation history in this region.

Abstract: Context: The Canis Major (CMa) star-forming region, a remote molecular cloud complex within the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave, remains under-explored in the literature. Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region.

TL;DR: No radio emission detected from wide-orbit brown dwarf companions using GMRT and VLA observations, with upper limits down to ~25 μJy/beam, providing tentative constraints on magnetic field models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate coherent radio emission from wide-orbit brown dwarf companions as indicators of their magnetic fields, exploring emission mechanisms through rapid rotation or magnetosphere-wind interactions with host stars.

Method: Analyzed ~60 hours of GMRT and VLA data at 0.3-2 GHz for six well-characterized systems with wide-orbit brown dwarf companions orbiting G, K, and M-type stars, using Stokes V polarization and light-curve analysis for burst detection.

Result: No detections obtained with 3σ upper limits down to ~25 μJy/beam in Stokes V; no evidence of short, intense radio bursts; upper limits provide tentative constraints on model parameters but limited by observational coverage and variability.

Conclusion: Current non-detections provide preliminary constraints, but next-generation radio interferometers with improved sensitivity will likely enable detection over a wider range of model parameters for brown dwarf magnetic field studies.

Abstract: With the improvements in radio interferometry sensitivity, the quest for coherent radio emission from exoplanets and ultra-cool dwarfs, which is indicative of their magnetic fields, has gained significant momentum in recent years. We investigated the relatively unexplored possibility of radio emission from wide-orbit brown dwarf companions, which may radiate through rapid rotation, as in isolated ultra-cool dwarfs, or via interactions between their extended magnetospheres and the host star's wind. We analysed $\sim 60$ hours of Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data for a set of well-characterized systems previously unobserved at 0.3-2 GHz. The targets include companions orbiting the G-type stars HD 26161 and BD-004475, the K-type HD 153557A and $ν$ Oph, and the M dwarfs GJ 3626 and 2MJ01225093-2439505. No detections were obtained with 3$σ$ upper limits down to $\sim 25\,μ$Jy/beam in Stokes V in the best cases. The light-curve analysis also revealed no evidence of short ($\gtrsim$ minutes), intense ($\gtrsim$ mJy) radio bursts. The upper limits provide tentative constraints on model parameters. However, the effects of model uncertainties, limited observational coverage, and intrinsic variability or beaming of the emission must be considered. The improvement in sensitivity of the next-generation radio interferometers will likely allow to go below the expected flux range over a much larger range of free parameters.

TL;DR: Data-driven MHD simulation successfully reproduces CME initiation from super active region AR 13663 with only 1-minute time lag between observed flare peak and simulated flux rope velocity peak, revealing multi-stage kinematic evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMEs are primary drivers of adverse space-weather events, but their initiation and onset prediction remain insufficiently understood due to complexity of magnetic topology and physical processes in real solar source regions.

Method: Fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of CME initiation from super active region AR 13663, using observational data to drive the model.

Result: Successfully reproduced CME initiation with only 1-minute time lag between observed flare peak and simulated flux rope velocity peak. The eruptive structure exhibited multi-stage kinematic evolution: initial slow acceleration (torus instability), plateau at nearly stationary height (downward tension force from overlying toroidal field), and subsequent impulsive acceleration (fast magnetic reconnection).

Conclusion: CME initiation in real events is inherently multistage. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress flux rope rise and produce plateau phase even when torus instability occurs. Fast magnetic reconnection beneath flux rope drives impulsive eruption. The close agreement demonstrates strong potential of data-driven model for predicting CME onset.

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the primary drivers of adverse space-weather events, yet their initiation and onset prediction remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the magnetic topology and physical processes in real solar source regions. Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset.

Motivation: High expansion velocity carbon stars (HVCs) are rare evolved stars with C-rich chemistry but O-rich star expansion velocities. AFGL2233 is proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning, making its chemical study essential to understand HVC nature and evolution.

Method: Complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under LVG approximation to derive column densities and fractional abundances for >30 molecular species including isotopologues.

Result: Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies luminosity ~2 Lsun consistent with initial mass 4.5-9 Msun. Molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. Isotopic ratios vary among species (12C/13C: 7-55). C2H/C4H ratio abnormally high compared to C-rich AGB stars. Presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or companion influence.

Conclusion: AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction, explaining its chemical peculiarities as a high expansion velocity carbon star.

Abstract: High expansion velocity carbon stars (HVCs) are a rare class of evolved stars whose circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) combine C-rich chemistry with unusually high expansion velocities typical of O-rich massive evolved stars. AFGL2233 has been proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning. Studying its chemistry is essential to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction.

TL;DR: Revisits thermal instability in astrophysical plasmas, refining classification of instability domains with thermal conduction, validating Waters & Proga's classification for small Field lengths, and discussing implications for cool coronal rain formation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate and expand understanding of thermal instability domains in uniform, non-magnetic astrophysical plasmas, building on Field (1965) and Waters & Proga (2019) work, with focus on classification refinement and implications for astrophysical phenomena like coronal rain.

Method: In-depth analysis of Field's dispersion relation for infinite uniform hydrodynamic medium with heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction (using Spitzer's parallel conductivity). Examines instability domains across wavelength ranges (short, intermediate, long) and generates growth-rate/dispersion diagrams.

Result: Confirms Waters & Proga's classification of seven instability regions when Field length ≤ thermal wavelength. Shows simplified classification impractical for larger Field lengths. Refines classification with thermal conduction inclusion and discusses catastrophic cooling instability implications for cool coronal rain formation.

Conclusion: Validates existing classifications under specific conditions, proposes new insights into complex instability behaviors, and enhances theoretical framework for thermal instability in astrophysical plasmas, particularly relevant to phenomena like coronal rain formation.

Abstract: Thermal instability plays a crucial role in the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas. Building upon the foundational work of Field (1965) and the subsequent analysis by Waters and Proga (2019), this study revisits the characteristics of thermal instability in a uniform, non-magnetic medium. Our primary aim is to reevaluate and expand the understanding of instability domains, focusing on the classification and characteristics of thermal and acoustic modes in the presence of heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. Except for Spitzers expression for parallel thermal conductivity, the heating and cooling processes are unspecified. Additionally, we investigate the existence of isobaric and isochoric thermal modes across the extreme limits of very short and very long wavelengths, as well as at intermediate wavelengths. We perform an in-depth analysis of the dispersion relation for an infinite, uniform hydrodynamic medium, as initially derived by Field (1965). This approach enables the generation of growth-rate and dispersion diagrams, providing insight into the behaviour of thermal instability across different wavelength ranges. With the inclusion of thermal conduction, our study refines the classification of the seven instability regions previously outlined by Waters and Proga (2019). Our findings confirm that their classification holds when the Field length is smaller than or comparable to the thermal wavelength. For larger Field lengths, a simplified classification becomes impractical. Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of the catastrophic cooling instability (Waters and Stricklan 2025) in the context of cool coronal rain formation. Our work not only validates certain classifications, but also proposes new insights into complex instability behaviours, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework established by Field and others.
