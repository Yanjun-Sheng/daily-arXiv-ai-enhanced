  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing space weather impacts on geospace. Previous studies lacked significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at specific vantage points using multiple observatories separated azimuthally.

Method: Multipoint analysis using high-resolution magnetic field observations from four spacecraft at Sun-Earth L1 point (ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR) separated by 80 RE along dawn-dusk direction. Analysis of turbulence associated with October 10, 2024 solar storm using field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades.

Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at flux rope interaction region indicates internal processes like magnetic reconnection strongly influence ICME plasma evolution.

Conclusion: First demonstration of pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth, highlighting their potential role in space weather impacts and the importance of multipoint measurements for understanding ICME evolution.

Abstract: Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.

### [2] [Solar active region scaling laws revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13677)
*Guilherme A. L. Nogueira,Robertus Erdelyi,Ruihui Wang,Kristof Petrovay*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper establishes scaling laws for solar active region properties (area, pole separation, tilt angle) as functions of magnetic flux and latitude using ARISE database, identifies deviations, and proposes deep convective zone origin for flux loops with anti-Hale ARs explained as fully curled XO-loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide accurate scaling laws for active region properties that are crucial for space climate modeling (flux transport and dynamo models) and to constrain the subsurface origin of active regions, addressing inconsistencies in previous studies.

Method: Analysis of the ARISE active region database covering cycles 23-25, determining scaling relations for area, pole separation, and tilt angle against magnetic flux and heliographic latitude, modeling residuals, and examining tilt angle distributions of non-Hale ARs.

Result: Established scaling laws for active region properties with magnetic flux and latitude; found that anti-Hale ARs and non-Hales in general do not follow Joy's law but have vanishing mean tilt; proposed that anti-Hale ARs are fully curled XO-loops with excess at low tilts due to mechanical resistance.

Conclusion: The scaling relations are recommended for space climate research; results support a scenario where active region flux loops originate in deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during rise via Coriolis force, with anti-Hale ARs resulting from extreme torques on fully curled loops.

Abstract: The systematic variation of solar active region (AR) properties with their magnetic flux has been the subject of numerous studies but the proposed scaling laws still vary rather widely. A correct representation of these laws and the deviations from them is important for modelling the source term in surface flux transport and dynamo models of space climate variation, and it may also help constrain the subsurface origin of active regions. Here we determine active region scaling laws based on the recently constructed ARISE active region data base listing bipolar ARs for cycle 23, 24 and 25. For the area $A$, pole separation $d$ and tilt angle $γ$ we find scalings against magnetic flux $Φ$ and heliographic latitude $λ$. Residuals from these relations are also modelled. These scaling relations are recommended for use in space climate research for the modelling of future data or missing past data, as well as for the identification of candidate rogue ARs. We confirm that the tilt angle distribution of non-Hale ARs shows a significant excess at low tilts (anti-Hale ARs). In contrast to earlier studies we show that neither the anti-Hale ARs nor non-Hales in general follow Joy's law: instead, their tilt angle distribution is best represented by vanishing mean tilt. These results are most easily reconciled with a scenario where the AR flux loops originate in the deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during their rise under the action of the Coriolis force. A small fraction of the loops is subjected to extreme, intermittent torques resulting in either very large tilts or anti-Hale orientation. Anti-Hale ARs are suggested to be fully curled `XO-loops', and their excess is caused by a simple mechanical effect, as the contact of their legs increases resistance against further deformation by the torque.

### [3] [AT 2025abao: the fourth luminous red nova in M 31](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13678)
*A. Reguitti,A. Pastorello,G. Valerin,F. D. Romanov,A. Siviero,Y. -Z. Cai,S. Ciroi,N. Elias-Rosa,T. Iijima,E. Kankare,N. Koivisto,T. Kravtsov,E. Mason,K. Matilainen,A. C. Mura,P. Ochner,T. M. Reynolds,M. D. Stritzinger*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: AT 2025abao is the fourth luminous red nova discovered in M31, showing a plateau light curve with detailed progenitor information from an M giant/AGB star.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the fourth luminous red nova in M31 (AT 2025abao) and understand its progenitor system, particularly using detailed archival information to study the connection between common envelope properties and light curve morphology in LRNe.

Method: Photometric and spectroscopic observations of AT 2025abao, including multi-band light curves and spectral evolution analysis from early to late phases, with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy to examine line profiles and archival infrared data of the progenitor.

Result: AT 2025abao reached peak magnitude of g=15.1 mag (M_g=-9.5±0.1), showed a 70-day plateau in red bands while declining linearly in blue bands, evolved from blue continuum with narrow Balmer emission to yellow continuum (6000 K) with metal absorption lines, and revealed counter-P Cygni Hα profile. Archival infrared SED confirms an M giant/AGB progenitor.

Conclusion: The dichotomy in LRN light curves (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope, with AT 2025abao providing rare detailed progenitor information supporting this interpretation.

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2025abao, the fourth discovered in M 31. The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$α$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope.

### [4] [Modelling the Break in the Specific Angular Momentum within the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13683)
*Indrani Das,Shantanu Basu,Nagayoshi Ohashi,Eduard Vorobyov,Yusuke Aso*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper identifies a transition zone between infalling-rotating envelopes and Keplerian disks in protostellar systems, characterized by a jump in specific angular momentum profile, and uses MHD simulations to explain the physics while confirming observations in L1527 IRS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms governing the transition from infalling-rotating envelopes to Keplerian disks in protostellar systems, particularly the angular momentum redistribution during star-disk formation.

Method: Global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from supercritical prestellar cores, forming disk and envelope structures self-consistently, combined with analysis of ALMA eDisk observations of L1527 IRS.

Result: Simulations reveal the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ) features a jump in j-r profile driven by positive local gravitational torques, with specific boundaries defined by centrifugal radius and centrifugal barrier. Observations of L1527 IRS show a similar j-r jump, confirming ENDTRANZ as an observable kinematic feature.

Conclusion: The j-r profile jump serves as a kinematic tracer for the ENDTRANZ, providing insights into angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation, with implications for understanding protostellar system evolution.

Abstract: The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_φ\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_φ\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_φ$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.

### [5] [Habitable Zones Around Massive Stars: From the Main Sequence to Supergiants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13875)
*Devesh Nandal,Abraham Loeb*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Massive stars (0.8-120 M☉) have extremely limited habitable zones due to intense UV radiation and winds, with main-sequence HZs disappearing above 15 M☉, though they may host ~10⁵ Earth-like planets in the Milky Way for biosignature searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify whether massive stars can host Earth-like habitable planets despite their intense ultraviolet radiation and strong stellar winds, challenging the presumption that they preclude habitability.

Method: Used rotating and non-rotating GENEC evolutionary tracks for solar-metallicity stars (0.8-120 M☉) to map time-dependent habitable zones. Derived bolometric climate HZ boundaries and applied XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. Calculated annulus lifetime, continuous residence time, and maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets.

Result: Found sharp main-sequence ceiling: HZs become extremely narrow by 12 M☉ and disappear by 15 M☉. A 9 M☉ star sustains HZ for ~30 Myr at 70-130 AU. Post-main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to 25-30 M☉ for 0.03-1.5 Myr at hundreds to ~10³ AU. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes without altering high mass ceiling. IMF weighting shows massive stars contribute only ~10⁻⁴ of habitable planet-time budget, but still host ~10⁵ Earth analogues in Milky Way.

Conclusion: Massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy's overall habitability budget due to extremely limited habitable zones and short lifetimes, but they may provide short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches, adding significant numbers of potentially habitable planets to the Milky Way.

Abstract: Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\,M_\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\,M_\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\sim 30$~Myr at $\sim 70$-$130$~AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\,M_\odot$ and disappears by $15\,M_\odot$. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to $\sim 25$-$30\,M_\odot$, but only for $\sim 0.03$-$1.5$~Myr at hundreds to $\sim 10^3$~AU, disappearing by $\sim 40\,M_\odot$. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches.

### [6] [Three-dimensional kink modes in solar coronal slabs: group velocities and their implications for impulsively excited waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13952)
*Jing Liu,Bo Li,Mijie Shi,Mingzhe Guo,Hui Yu*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis of group velocities for 3D MHD kink modes in coronal slabs, revealing three subgroups with distinct velocity-field relationships and implications for impulsive wave excitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little attention has been paid to group velocities of 3D MHD waves in solar coronal seismology, despite their importance for understanding wave propagation and mode characterization in coronal structures.

Method: Linear, ideal, pressureless MHD framework with symmetrically structured equilibrium slab in one transverse direction. Numerical solution of dispersion relation complemented by analytical analysis. Three-subgroup categorization scheme based on relationships between group/phase velocities and equilibrium magnetic field.

Result: Identified three subgroups: "B₀-same-side A" and "B₀-same-side F" where group and phase velocities sit on same side of magnetic field, and "B₀-straddling" where velocities lie astride magnetic field. The straddling subgroup is unique to structured media and exists for both fundamental and overtone modes. Wavefronts directed toward magnetic field derive exclusively from straddling modes.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive understanding of 3D kink mode group velocities in coronal slabs, revealing novel velocity-field relationships not found in uniform media, with direct implications for interpreting impulsively excited waves and wavefront morphology in solar corona.

Abstract: Little attention has been paid to group velocities of three-dimensional (3D) MHD waves in solar coronal seismology. This study aims to present a rather comprehensive examination on the group velocities of trapped 3D kink modes in coronal slabs, emphasizing the connection of mode analysis to both mode characterization and impulsively excited 3D kink waves. We work in linear, ideal, pressureless MHD, and take the equilibrium slab to be symmetrically structured only in one transverse direction. The dispersion relation is numerically solved, with the results understood by making in-depth analytical progress. We address both the transverse fundamental and its first overtone. We develop a three-subgroup scheme for categorizing 3D kink modes on the plane spanned by the axial and out-of-plane wavenumbers. The group ($\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$) and phase velocities ($\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$) sit on the same side of the equilibrium magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) for the ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side A'' and ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side F'' subgroups, which are further discriminated by the directional similarity of $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{B}_0$. The ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup is peculiar in that $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$ lie astride $\vec{B}_0$, a feature that cannot be found for waves in unbounded uniform media in pressureless MHD. This ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup pertains to both the fundamental and its overtones. We further place our results in the context of impulsive waves, employing the method of stationary phase to predict the large-time wavefront morphology in the plane of symmetry of the equilibrium slab. Wavefronts directed toward $\vec{B}_0$ derive exclusively from ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' modes, and are confined to narrow sectors.

### [7] [Superhumps and their Relation to the Disk Instability Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13996)
*Daisaku Nogami*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Review of superhump phenomena in cataclysmic variables covering observational advances, theoretical interpretations, and open problems since the thermal-tidal instability framework was established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize key observational advances in superhump research since the establishment of the thermal-tidal instability framework, discuss theoretical interpretations within the disk instability model, and highlight remaining open problems in understanding these phenomena.

Method: Comprehensive review synthesizing decades of time-resolved photometry from coordinated amateur observer networks, wide-field robotic surveys, and space-based missions (Kepler and TESS), combined with theoretical analysis within the disk instability model framework.

Result: Documentation of diverse superhump-related phenomena including delayed superhump development, early superhumps in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, systematic stage A-B-C evolution, negative superhumps, and superhumps in related systems (intermediate polars and AM CVn stars).

Conclusion: Superhumps remain a powerful probe of disk dynamics, binary parameters, and the interplay between thermal, tidal, and geometric effects in accretion disks, with continued importance for understanding cataclysmic variable physics.

Abstract: Since the discovery of superhumps in 1974, these photometric modulations have provided a crucial observational window into disk instabilities in cataclysmic variable stars, particularly the tidal instability associated with the 3:1 resonance. Over the past few decades, extensive time-resolved photometry has revealed a rich diversity of superhump-related phenomena, including delayed superhump development, early superhumps in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, systematic stage A-B-C evolution, negative superhumps, and superhumps observed in related systems such as intermediate polars and AM CVn stars. In this invited review, we summarize key observational advances since the establishment of the thermal-tidal instability framework, discuss their theoretical interpretations within the disk instability model, and highlight remaining open problems. These developments have been driven by coordinated networks of amateur observers, wide-field robotic surveys, and continuous high-precision space-based photometry from Kepler and TESS. Together, they demonstrate that superhumps remain a powerful probe of disk dynamics, binary parameters, and the interplay between thermal, tidal, and geometric effects in accretion disks.

*Scarlet Elgueta,Paula Jofré,Claudia Aguilera-Gómez,Ditte Slumstrup,Álvaro Rojas-Arriagada,Ulrike Heiter,Laia Casamiquela,Manuela Zoccali,Clare Worley,Caroline Soubiran*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Researchers developed a robust framework for validating atomic absorption lines in near-infrared Y, J, and H bands using laboratory data and benchmark stars, identifying reliable transitions for elements like Mg, Si, Ca, Fe, and Sr II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared abundance determinations face larger uncertainties than optical measurements due to less validated line lists and atmospheric models. The study aims to establish a homogeneous, reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in near-infrared bands using exclusively laboratory atomic data to improve infrared spectroscopy reliability.

Method: Analyzed CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning wide parameter ranges. Computed synthetic spectra using benchmark stellar parameters and evaluated each transition independently through a quantitative sequence examining line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles.

Result: Identified a robust set of atomic transitions consistent across all stellar parameters. Lines of alpha-elements (Mg I, Si I, Ca I) and several Fe I transitions satisfied all robustness criteria. Among neutron-capture species, only Sr II provided consistently reliable lines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation, offering a systematic approach that will remain valuable as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve.

Abstract: The advent of new and more powerful infrared spectrographs has significantly motivated the advancement of the study of atomic and molecular line lists and stellar atmosphere models. While optical abundance determinations rely on extensively validated line lists and modeling frameworks, infrared measurements still face larger uncertainties, largely driven by the choice of atmospheric models and the quality of the available atomic data. In this work, we aim to deliver a homogeneous and reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in the Y, J, and H bands (9800 - 18000 (Angstrom)), based exclusively on laboratory atomic data. We analyse CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning a wide range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Synthetic spectra are computed using the benchmark stellar parameters, and each transition is evaluated independently in every star through a quantitative sequence that examines line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and the agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles. We identify a set of robust atomic transitions in these bands that remain consistent across the full range of stellar parameters represented in our sample. Lines of alpha-elements such as Mg I, Si I, and Ca I, together with several Fe I transitions, satisfy all robustness criteria. Among the neutron-capture species explored, only Sr II provides lines that consistently meet our requirements. Beyond the specific list of accepted transitions, this study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve.

### [9] [Seismic detection of core magnetic fields in red giants using the gravity offset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14570)
*Matisse Villate,Sébastien Deheuvels,Jérôme Ballot*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: New method detects magnetic fields in red giant cores using asteroseismic bias in gravity offset measurements, identifying 218 Kepler red giants with abnormal ε_g values and confirming magnetic fields in 34-260 kG range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase magnetic field detections in red giant cores by exploiting the known bias that unaccounted core magnetic fields create in gravity offset (ε_g) measurements, establishing a widely applicable method for all red giants.

Method: Selected 218 Kepler red giants with abnormal ε_g values, used statistical criteria to identify significant mixed modes, fitted asymptotic expression for mixed modes to observed frequencies using Bayesian inference (accounting for magnetic fields and rotation), then assessed magnetic field detection probability and measured field intensity using stellar models.

Result: Found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG; corrected ε_g values now agree with expected values; mass distribution of magnetic giants similar to complete red giant catalogue but different from red giants with suppressed dipole modes; core rotation distribution similar to general red giant population.

Conclusion: The method successfully detects magnetic fields in red giant cores using asteroseismic bias; detected fields may not have predominant impact on angular momentum redistribution, or other red giants may harbor undetected internal fields.

Abstract: Magnetic fields are known to efficiently redistribute angular momentum in stars. They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $ε_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $ε_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $ε_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.

### [10] [Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604)
*Varvara Karteyeva,Ruslan Nakibov,Igor Petrashkevich,Mikhail Medvedev,Anton Vasyunin*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Laboratory FTIR spectra of solid methane and its binary mixtures at 6.7K and 10K reveal 20% stronger band strengths in mixtures than pure methane, enabling improved JWST data interpretation for interstellar environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solid methane is important in interstellar and planetary environments but lacks comprehensive low-temperature (<10K) laboratory data, particularly for binary mixtures relevant to dark molecular clouds and protostars.

Method: FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode using ISEAge setup at 6.7K and 10K, with weighted χ² minimization for fitting; analysis of pure methane and binary mixtures with H₂O, CO₂, CH₃OH, NH₃.

Result: Infrared spectra show 20% increase in band strengths for methane mixtures compared to pure methane at 10K; distinct spectral features in non-H₂O environments; successful application to JWST data for methane distribution in B335; phase transition data between phases II* and II.

Conclusion: The dataset enables more accurate JWST observation interpretation for methane in interstellar environments; spectra publicly available on Zenodo for community use in fitting JWST data.

Abstract: Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited.
  Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation.
  Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $χ^2$ minimization is used for the fitting.
  Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II.
  Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.

### [11] [Infrared period-luminosity relations of Galactic Miras based on multi-epoch photometry and the Gaia parallax uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14775)
*S. Uttenthaler,T. Lebzelter,S. Meingast*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Galactic Miras follow clear near-IR period-luminosity relations, are fainter than LMC counterparts, and Gaia parallax uncertainties for these stars are underestimated by ~1.3× for precise measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies of Galactic LPV stars' period-luminosity relations were limited by poor distance measurements; this study aims to establish precise PL relations for solar-neighborhood Miras using improved Gaia parallaxes and multi-epoch near-IR photometry.

Method: Used multi-epoch near-IR photometry from DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogs, Gaia parallax distances, and optical pulsation periods for well-selected solar-neighborhood Miras to derive PL relations in nine near-IR bands, then constructed synthetic SEDs to derive period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations.

Result: Clear PL relations emerge in all nine near-IR bands; Galactic Miras are fainter than LMC counterparts; Gaia parallax uncertainties are underestimated by factors 1.0-1.7 (most likely ~1.3) for stars with fractional parallax uncertainty <0.1; distances are generally overestimated for less precise parallaxes; large error-inflation factors reported in literature are unrealistic.

Conclusion: The study successfully establishes precise near-IR PL relations for Galactic Miras, validates Gaia parallax measurements for these extended variable stars, and provides evidence that previously reported error-inflation factors are excessive, lending confidence to Gaia's astrometric performance for AGB stars.

Abstract: Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.

### [12] [Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781)
*D. P. K. Banerjee,A. Evans,Watson P. Varricatt,N. M. Ashok*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Strong evidence that V4332 Sgr was a stellar merger event based on unusual carbon isotope ratio and pre-eruption disk observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) bridge the luminosity gap between novae and supernovae, but their eruption mechanisms remain unclear with mergers being the favored but unproven hypothesis for most objects.

Method: High-resolution infrared spectroscopy of CO fundamental band to measure carbon isotope ratio (12C/13C), analysis of pre-eruption disk geometry, and identification of previously unreported multiple outbursts.

Result: Unusually low 12C/13C ratio of 3.5±1 indicates deep mixing of CNO-processed material; edge-on disk observed before eruption supports merger scenario; multiple outbursts discovered consistent with LRN characteristics.

Conclusion: V4332 Sgr provides strong evidence for a stellar merger event, supporting the merger hypothesis for Luminous Red Novae eruptions.

Abstract: Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.

*M. R. Schmidt*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Detection of a new TiO molecular band at 5814.8 Å in M-type giant spectra, identified as the ¹Π-a¹Δ singlet system, which resolves discrepancies in synthetic spectra for late-type M giants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TiO is crucial for modeling M-star atmospheres and spectra, but synthetic spectra for late-type M giants show systematic discrepancies in the 5810-5850 Å range, prompting investigation of TiO absorption cross-sections.

Method: Analysis of experimental TiO absorption cross-sections to identify molecular bands; comparison of relative band strengths from C³Δ-X³Δ and B³Π-X³Δ systems; validation through synthetic spectrum calculations for 30 Her (M6 III) compared to observed MELCHIORS library spectrum.

Result: Detection of a new TiO molecular band with R-head at 5814.8 Å, identified as the ¹Π-a¹Δ singlet system overlapping the 1-3 band of C³Δ-X³Δ system; empirical band intensity derived and validated; band is sufficiently strong to affect flux distribution in cool star spectra.

Conclusion: The newly identified TiO singlet band resolves spectral discrepancies in late-type M giants and must be included in atmospheric models for accurate synthetic spectra of cool stars.

Abstract: TiO plays an important role in determining the atmospheric structure of M-type stars and in shaping the visual part of their spectra. We compute synthetic spectra for late-type M giants and identify systematic discrepancies in the wavelength range 5810-5850 A. To investigate the origin of these discrepancies, we analyse experimental TiO absorption cross-sections. We report the detection of a molecular band of the singlet system $^{1}Π$-a$^{1}Δ$ of the TiO, with an R-head located at 5814.8 A, overlapping the 1-3 band of the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ system. The lower state of the band is identified as the a$^1Δ$ v"=0 state, while the upper state is most likely the $^1Π$ in its ground vibrational state. The empirical band intensity is derived by comparing the relative strengths of neighbouring bands from the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ and B$^3Π$-X$^3Δ$ systems in the experimental cross-section. The band intensity is further validated by synthetic spectrum calculations for the late-type giant 30 Her (M6 III) and comparison with its observed spectrum from the MELCHIORS library. The newly identified band is sufficiently strong to affect the flux distribution in the spectra of cool stars.

### [14] [[C/N] Ages and Extra-Mixing for [Fe/H] <- 0.5: Insights from the LMC and SMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14925)
*Yuxi Lu,John D. Roberts,Joshua T. Povick,Marc H. Pinsonneault,Madeline Howell,David L. Nidever,Jennifer A. Johnson*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper investigates extra mixing in low-metallicity stars using Magellanic Clouds to disentangle mass-metallicity degeneracies, finding empirical corrections work for lower-mass stars while theoretical models succeed down to ~1.25 M⊙, and presenting first evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above ~1.8 M⊙ at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The [C/N]-age relation is a powerful tool for Milky Way formation history, but at metallicities below [Fe/H] < -0.5, extra mixing modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner, complicating age determinations. In the MW, constraining extra mixing's mass dependence is challenging due to degeneracies between mass and metallicity in predominantly old, low-mass stars.

Method: The study uses Magellanic Clouds to disentangle mass-metallicity degeneracies by comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models. This approach isolates the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] ~ -0.7.

Result: Empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars (< 1.25 M⊙), while theoretical models successfully reproduce observed mass dependence down to ~1.25 M⊙. The paper presents first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above ~1.8 M⊙ at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-log g or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable calibration of [C/N]-age relations applicable to low-metallicity stars in the MW and external galaxies.

Abstract: The [C/N]-age relation has become a powerful tool for reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way (MW), providing the largest age sample for field giant stars. However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $< -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $< -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($< 1.25$ $M_{\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies.

### [15] [The radial velocity curve for HeII emission cannot be used for component mass determination in SS433](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14978)
*A. V. Dodin,K. A. Postnov,A. M. Cherepashchuk*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: HeII 4686Å emission line observations in SS433 reveal its formation region is not eclipsed, larger than both donor star and disk photosphere, and its radial velocity curve is independent of precessional phase, suggesting it doesn't reflect orbital motion of the compact object.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of HeII 4686Å emission line formation in SS433 and determine whether it can be reliably used for spectroscopic mass estimates of the binary components, given its potential as a tracer of orbital motion in this unique microquasar system.

Method: Obtained 150+ measurements of HeII 4686Å emission line during 388 nights in 2020-2025 using the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph on the 2.5 m telescope at Caucasian Mountain Observatory, analyzing line formation region, eclipsing behavior, and radial velocity curve dependence on precessional phase.

Result: HeII emission line formation region is not eclipsed and significantly larger than both donor star and supercritical accretion disk photosphere. Radial velocity curve is independent of precessional phase and inconsistent with photometric curve, indicating the line does not reflect orbital motion of the compact object.

Conclusion: HeII emission line in SS433 cannot be used for reliable spectroscopic mass estimates of binary components since it doesn't trace orbital motion, challenging previous assumptions about this line as a kinematic tracer in the system.

Abstract: More than 150 measurements of the HeII 4686A emission line in spectra of SS433 were obtained during 388 nights in 2020-2025 with the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph on the 2.5 m telescope of Caucasian Mountain Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute. We found that the HeII emission line formation region is not eclipsed and is significantly larger than both the donor star and the photosphere of the supercritical accretion disk. The HeII radial velocity curve was found to be independent of the precessional phase and inconsistent with the photometric curve. These findings suggest that the HeII line does not reflect the orbital motion of the compact object. Therefore, spectroscopic estimates of the masses of the components in SS433 based on the HeII emission line can be unrealistic.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Simple MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST low-resolution spectra show strong cross-survey generalization to DESI medium-resolution spectra, with fine-tuning further improving performance. Transformer embeddings help in metal-rich regimes but underperform in metal-poor regimes compared to direct spectral MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of cross-survey generalization in stellar spectral analysis, particularly transferring from low-resolution (LAMOST LRS) to moderate-resolution (DESI MRS) surveys, using pre-trained models.

Method: Pre-train MLPs on LAMOST LRS spectra or their embeddings, then fine-tune for DESI MRS application. Compare MLPs trained directly on spectra vs. transformer-based embeddings. Evaluate fine-tuning strategies: residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning.

Result: MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance even without fine-tuning; modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves results. Transformer embeddings show advantages for metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regimes but underperform in metal-poor regimes. Optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on specific stellar parameter.

Conclusion: Simple pre-trained MLPs provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.

Abstract: Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.

### [17] [Ultramassive Black Holes and the Three $M$-$σ$ Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13382)
*Andrew King*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Observations confirm the M ∝ σ⁴ relation across galaxy types but with different normalizations, causing fitted exponents >4 in mixed samples; current black hole masses don't reach theoretical maxima due to insufficient gas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand recent observations of ultramassive black holes in relation to the M-σ scaling relation across different galaxy types, and to explain why observed masses don't reach theoretical maximum values.

Method: Analysis of observational data on ultramassive black holes, theoretical modeling of the M-σ relation, and consideration of accretion physics including the need for longer accretion episodes in certain galaxy types to expel gas.

Result: The M ∝ σ⁴ relation holds with same form but different normalizations across spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and cluster ellipticals; fitted exponents in mixed samples slightly exceed 4 due to normalization differences; observed black hole masses don't reach theoretical maximum values set by ISCO and self-gravity radius equality.

Conclusion: The consistent M-σ⁴ scaling across galaxy types supports theoretical predictions, with normalization differences explained by varying accretion histories; insufficient gas in host galaxies prevents black holes from reaching theoretical maximum masses possible through disc accretion.

Abstract: I consider recent observations of ultramassive black holes. These appear to confirm theoretical predictions that the relation between central black hole mass $M$ and spheroid velocity dispersion $σ$ has the same form $M \propto σ^4$ in spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and cluster ellipticals, but has differing normalizations. These arise from the need for longer black hole accretion episodes to expel the gas otherwise potentially able to feed the holes in the latter two types of host. In a sample drawn from a mixture of galaxy host types the fitted power of $σ$ will slightly exceed the theoretically-derived value of 4 because of the differing normalizations. The observed hole masses do not currently reach the theoretical maximum values possible for disc accretion, set by the equality of the ISCO and self-gravity radii, probably because the host galaxies have insufficient gas.

TL;DR: KRIOS is a new basis-expansion N-body code that bridges the gap between accurate but expensive direct N-body simulations and fast but oversimplified particle-spray methods for modeling globular cluster stellar streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling globular cluster stellar streams have limitations: particle-spray methods make strong assumptions about escape physics and abstract away internal progenitor dynamics, while direct N-body methods are prohibitively expensive for realistic systems with N>10^5 particles.

Method: The authors present KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics that combines computational efficiency with physical accuracy. They validate KRIOS against NBODY6++GPU cluster models and compare it to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams.

Result: KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models and associated streams more accurately than particle-spray methods in a fraction of the wall-clock time. Stream morphology and kinematics show greatest disagreement between methods when progenitors are tightly bound to the host galaxy, as these systems experience stronger tidal forces.

Conclusion: KRIOS successfully bridges the runtime vs. accuracy gap for stellar stream modeling. The study identifies which elements of progenitor physics are most important for accurate stream modeling and discusses how these could be incorporated into particle-spray methods to improve their fidelity.

Abstract: Globular cluster stellar streams probe galaxy-formation processes and can potentially reveal the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N>10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Empirical model for emergent Lyα spectra from high-redshift galaxies, constrained by VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam observations at z∼5-6, forward-modeling selection effects to characterize scatter in Lyα properties and improve match to independent Subaru data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lyα line from high-redshift galaxies probes the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but interpretation is complicated by IGM attenuation and large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in emergent spectra due to interstellar/circumgalactic media properties and observational selection effects.

Method: Build flexible empirical model characterizing emergent Lyα luminosity, velocity offset relative to systemic redshift, and Hα luminosity with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on UV magnitude. Constrain distributions using z∼5-6 galaxy observations from VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters.

Result: Model produces Lyα equivalent width distributions that better match independent Subaru observations than previous empirical models. Extended distributions of Lyα equivalent widths and velocity offsets could facilitate Lyα transmission during early EoR stages. Model can identify GN-z11-like outliers potentially from merging systems.

Conclusion: Empirical model successfully characterizes scatter in emergent Lyα spectra, improving match to observations and providing framework for interpreting Lyα transmission during EoR. Model and fitting functions made publicly available for community use.

Abstract: The Lyman $α$ (Ly$α$) line from high-redshift galaxies is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$α$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$α$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$α$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$α$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$α$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$α$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$α$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$α$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available.

TL;DR: Three different stellar feedback subgrid models (mechanical, hybrid mechanical+thermal, delayed cooling) produce galaxies with similar stellar masses but lead to distinct CGM properties, highlighting model degeneracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cosmological simulations have unresolved scales for star formation and stellar feedback, requiring subgrid models. However, different approaches are degenerate and primarily calibrated to match stellar masses, making it unclear how they affect the circumgalactic medium (CGM).

Method: Three cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the same galaxy within a 5×10¹¹ M⊙ dark matter halo at z∼1, each with a different subgrid model: mechanical feedback, mechanical+thermal feedback (hybrid), and delayed cooling. All models were calibrated to match stellar mass to isolate CGM effects.

Result: Despite producing comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes and CGM properties: delayed cooling shows ejective feedback with high burstiness, mechanical feedback features preventive feedback at galaxy scale, and hybrid model shows preventive feedback at halo scale. Delayed cooling reduces baryon mass to half universal fraction while mechanical retains most baryons. Delayed cooling ejects more metals into CGM, with metals evenly distributed in delayed cooling and mechanical models but concentrated around satellites in hybrid model.

Conclusion: Different subgrid models that produce similar stellar masses lead to significantly different CGM properties, emphasizing the need for appropriate subgrid model design to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth beyond just matching stellar masses.

Abstract: Galaxy evolution is shaped by star formation and stellar feedback at scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations. Precise subgrid models are thus necessary, and different approaches have been developed. However, they are degenerate and often primarily calibrated to reproduce stellar masses from observations. To explore these degeneracies, we perform three cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the same galaxy within a $5\times10^{11}\rm\ M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $z\sim1$, each with a different subgrid model: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical feedback and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We calibrate the simulations to match in stellar mass, isolating the effect of the models on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes, resulting in notable variations in the CGM properties. The delayed cooling run is dominated by ejective feedback and exhibits high burstiness, whereas mechanical and the hybrid models primarily feature preventive feedback, respectively acting at the galaxy and halo scales. Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models. While for delayed cooling and mechanical feedback metals are almost evenly distributed in the CGM, they are concentrated around satellites in the hybrid model. These discrepancies emphasize the need to design an appropriate subgrid model to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth.

TL;DR: Different subgrid feedback models produce galaxies with similar stellar masses but distinct CGM properties, with absorption line diagnostics revealing model-specific discrepancies compared to observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degeneracies in subgrid models for galaxy evolution, which are typically calibrated only to match stellar masses, by comparing how different feedback models affect circumgalactic medium properties through absorption line diagnostics.

Method: Three state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations of the same galaxy with different subgrid models: mechanical feedback, combined mechanical+thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. Analysis focused on quasar absorption sightlines of HI, MgII, CIV, and OVI to compare CGM properties.

Result: Despite producing galaxies with identical stellar masses, models yield distinct feedback modes and CGM properties. Column densities and covering fractions effectively diagnose subgrid models. All simulations bracket observed column density distributions but show model-specific discrepancies: all fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions; delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions while others underproduce; mechanical feedback reproduces CIV covering fractions well while others show slight offsets.

Conclusion: Absorption line diagnostics provide strong constraints on subgrid models, revealing that current models have systematic deficiencies likely due to unresolved thermal structures (for HI and MgII) and insufficient metals (for CIV and OVI), suggesting missing physics such as AGN feedback or cosmic rays.

Abstract: Galaxy evolution is driven by star formation and stellar feedback on scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations, requiring robust subgrid models. However, these models remain degenerate, often calibrated primarily to match observed stellar masses. To explore these degeneracies, we conduct three state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations of the same galaxy, each incorporating different subgrid models: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We compare their circumgalactic media (CGM) through quasar absorption sightlines of HI, MgII, CIV, and OVI. Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with the same stellar masses, the models lead to distinct feedback modes and CGM properties. Column densities and covering fractions serve as effective diagnostics of subgrid models, with all four ions providing strong constraints as they trace diverse gas phases, exhibit complementary spatial distributions, and originate from different mechanisms. Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them. The simulation including mechanical feedback reproduces the observed CIV covering fractions well, whereas the other models show slight offsets. We argue that this discrepancy is likely driven by unresolved thermal structures for HI and MgII, and insufficient metals for CIV and OVI, arising from missing physics such as AGNs or cosmic rays.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that using a physically grounded period-luminosity-color (PLC) relation for Cepheid variables significantly improves distance precision to 2% per star by accounting for achromatic distance-modulus variations and reducing parallax error effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and Hubble constant determination by moving beyond simple period-luminosity relations to a physically motivated PLC relation that accounts for stellar radius and temperature effects.

Method: Analyzed multi-wavelength PLC relations for Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way using first-principles stellar physics, combining HST and Gaia parallaxes with individually determined reddenings, and applying bandpass-averaged corrections to recover wavelength-dependent instability strip properties.

Result: The PLC relation successfully recovers known Magellanic Cloud disk geometries, identifies achromatic parallax errors as dominant scatter source in Milky Way Cepheids, achieves 0.04 mag rms scatter (2% distance precision per star), and shows no significant metallicity correlation over -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex.

Conclusion: A physically grounded PLC relation provides superior precision and robustness for Cepheid distance measurements, offering significant improvements for the extragalactic distance scale and Hubble constant determination compared to traditional period-luminosity relations.

Abstract: We examine the multi-wavelength period-luminosity-color relations for Cepheid variables in the Large and Small magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant.

TL;DR: Analysis of massive star-forming complex W43 Main shows its star formation activity is consistent with average Galactic GHII regions despite its unique location at the Galactic Bar-Scutum arm junction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether W43 Main's unique location at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and Galactic Bar - where enhanced turbulence is expected - influences its star formation activity compared to other Galactic GHII regions.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis comparing 11-37 micron SOFIA-FORCAST maps with near-infrared to radio observations; SED fitting to constrain compact infrared object properties; examination of evolutionary states of extended subregions.

Result: Identified 20 compact infrared objects, with 16 (80%) classified as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. Key metrics (Lyman continuum photon production rate, mass of most massive MYSO, MYSO density) all consistent with survey-wide median values for Galactic GHII regions.

Conclusion: Despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment at the spiral arm-bar junction, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region, suggesting environmental location may not significantly alter current star formation properties.

Abstract: In this eighth paper of the SOFIA-FORCAST series on Milky Way GHII regions, we present an analysis of the massive star-forming complex W43 Main. We compared our 11 - 37 micron maps with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, and investigated the physical nature of compact sources and dust substructures. We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region.

TL;DR: Study of 106 strong-lens ETGs shows mass-density slope γ increases with surface density and decreases with redshift, validating evolutionary trends in massive galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the internal mass structure of early-type galaxies using strong gravitational lensing with background quasars, and to validate previously observed structural trends from galaxy-galaxy lensing systems.

Method: Analysis of 106 galaxy-scale strong lenses with spectroscopic redshifts, selecting 24 systems with high-quality data for joint strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. Developed iterative spectroscopic fitting to derive new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lenses, mitigating quasar contamination. Modeled total mass-density profile as power law ρ∝r^{-γ} with parameterization γ = γ₀ + γ_z·z_l + γ_s·logΣ̃, using flat ΛCDM framework with DESI BAO prior, constrained via Monte Carlo nested sampling.

Result: Constrained parameters to γ₀ = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}, γ_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}, and γ_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07} (68% confidence). Robustly demonstrated that γ increases with surface mass density (γ_s > 0) and decreases with redshift (γ_z < 0), indicating denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles at fixed redshift, while profiles become shallower at higher redshifts at fixed density.

Conclusion: Successfully applied joint lensing-dynamics method to substantial sample of lensed quasars, providing crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as potent probe of galaxy structure.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the internal mass structure of early-type galaxies (ETGs) based on 106 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses with background quasars, all having spectroscopic redshifts. From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $ρ\propto r^{-γ}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $γ= γ_0 + γ_z \cdot z_l + γ_s \cdot \log \tildeΣ$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\tildeΣ$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $Λ$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $γ_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $γ_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $γ_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $γ$ increases with surface mass density ($γ_s > 0$) and decreases with redshift ($γ_z < 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing--dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy--galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure.

TL;DR: Cold gas in galactic winds survives via molecular clouds losing their atomic envelopes during acceleration, explaining anomalous molecular-to-atomic ratios and requiring revised mass estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold atomic and molecular gas observed in galactic winds has survival mechanisms and origins that are poorly understood, particularly given unusual molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratios inconsistent with both disc values and chemical equilibrium predictions.

Method: Time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind to investigate non-equilibrium chemical states and cloud evolution during wind acceleration.

Result: CO and Hi emission comparable to observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but can be explained by molecule-dominated clouds that have rapidly lost their atomic envelopes and not yet reached new chemical equilibrium. These clouds have large molecular reservoirs and anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors.

Conclusion: Cold outflows originate from galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into winds but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes, suggesting the Milky Way's nuclear outflow is more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought, requiring revised mass estimates using non-disc conversion factors.

Abstract: Cold atomic and molecular gas are commonly observed in the winds of both external galaxies and the Milky Way, yet the survival and origin of these cool phases within hot galactic winds is poorly understood. To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought.

### [26] [Dense Molecular Clumps with Large Blue Asymmetries: Evidence for Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13992)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of MALT90 survey reveals 27 dense molecular clumps with blue asymmetric line profiles indicating collapse motions, confirmed by Mopra observations showing large asymmetries in HCO⁺ and smaller ones in HCN/HNC, consistent with self-absorption in collapsing clumps with extreme velocities ~2.4 km/s.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize dense molecular clumps undergoing gravitational collapse by analyzing asymmetric line profiles from the MALT90 survey, which can reveal infall motions in star-forming regions.

Method: Follow-up molecular line observations with Mopra 22-m telescope of 27 candidate clumps from MALT90 survey, analyzing asymmetry parameters (A) for multiple tracers (HCO⁺, HCN, HNC, C₂H, H¹³CO⁺) and hyperfine ratios, using two-component modeling to interpret line profiles.

Result: Confirmed blue asymmetries with large positive A values: HCO⁺ (0.69±0.01), HCN (0.35±0.01), HNC (0.28±0.01), and smaller for C₂H (0.15±0.02) and H¹³CO⁺ (0.18±0.03). HCN hyperfine ratios show abnormal F=1→1 weakness explained by self-absorption. Results consistent with collapsing clumps with extreme velocities V_inf ~2.4 km/s.

Conclusion: The sample represents dense molecular clumps undergoing rapid gravitational collapse, with line profiles showing self-absorption on red sides due to infall motions, providing evidence for extreme collapse velocities in these star-forming regions.

Abstract: An analysis of the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) survey has produced a sample of 27 candidate dense molecular clumps with large collapse motions, as revealed by large ``blue'' asymmetrical line profiles of the optically thick \hcop\, line. %with respect to the optically thin \nthp\, line. New, more sensitive molecular line observations of this sample, conducted with the Mopra 22-m telescope, confirm the blue asymmetries in the \hcop\, line profiles, with large, positive values of the asymmetry parameter $A$ ($\bar{A}_{HCO^+} = 0.69\pm0.01$), and positive, but smaller asymmetries in the \hcn\, and \hnc\, lines: ($\bar{A}_{HCN} = 0.35\pm0.01$ and $\bar{A}_{HNC} = 0.28\pm0.01$), as expected for a less optically thick tracer in collapsing clumps. The small, positive mean asymmetry parameters for \cch\, and \htcop, $\bar{A}_{C_2H} = 0.15\pm0.02$ and $\bar{A}_{H^{13}CO^+} = 0.18\pm0.03$, likely indicate slightly optically thick emission for at least some clumps. The hyperfine ratios for \nthp\, are in their optically thin, LTE, values, but for \hcn\ they are not; the $F=1 \to 1$ hyperfine line shows abnormally weak intensities. A simple two-component model shows that self-absorption of the background $F = 1 \to 1$ hyperfine line by the main $F = 2 \to 1$ hyperfine line of a cold, foreground, redshifted cloud can reproduce the observed \hcn\, hyperfine intensities and match the \hcn\, and \hcop\, line profiles. All of these results are consistent with self-absorption of the optically thick lines on the red side of the profile, as expected for collapsing clumps. A simple two-cloud model suggests that this sample represents dense clumps with extreme collapse velocities, $V_{inf} \sim 2.4$ \kms.

### [27] [Effective Magnetic Susceptibility of Dust Grains with Superparamagnetic Inclusions and Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14101)
*Thiem Hoang*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Develops an effective superparamagnetism model accounting for power-law size distribution of superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) in dust grains, showing how size distribution affects magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency compared to single-size SPI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies assumed single characteristic size for superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs), but realistic dust grains likely contain SPIs with a size distribution. This oversimplification may lead to inaccurate predictions of magnetic susceptibility, grain alignment efficiency, and magnetic dipole emission in the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm.

Method: Develops an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly incorporates a power-law size distribution of SPIs. Derives analytical expressions for zero-frequency susceptibility and frequency-dependent susceptibility, identifying critical blocking size and resonance size that dominate magnetic response. Introduces reduction factors F_eff and G_eff to account for distribution effects.

Result: Effective zero-frequency susceptibility is described by superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions at critical blocking size, reduced by factor F_eff ~ 0.1, with slight increase with dust temperature T_d (contrasting rapid decrease for single-size SPIs). Frequency-dependent susceptibility shows nearly flat spectrum below characteristic attempt frequency ν_0 due to progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies, with maximum susceptibility at resonance size N_res = (T_d/T_act) ln(ν_0/ω).

Conclusion: The power-law size distribution of SPIs significantly modifies magnetic susceptibility behavior compared to single-size models, with important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse astrophysical environments. The model provides more realistic treatment of superparamagnetism in dust grains.

Abstract: Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $ω$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\rm act}) \ln (ν_{0}/ω)$ with $T_{\rm act}$ activation temperature and $ν_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $χ_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}(ω)$ at $N_{\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $ν_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Galaxies in X-ray+optical groups and cosmic web nodes show more centrally concentrated star formation, with C-index correlating most strongly with distance to nearest node, suggesting multi-scale environmental processes concentrate star formation toward galaxy centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the environmental mechanisms causing quenching in nearby star-forming galaxies by studying how star formation concentration varies with local and large-scale environments.

Method: Combined GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data for galaxy groups and cosmic web reconstruction, eROSITA data for X-ray-emitting groups, and SAMI Galaxy Survey data for spatially-resolved star formation characterization using the C-index (log(r50,Hα/r50,cont)).

Result: Galaxies in X-ray+optical groups show lowest median C-index and highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star formation. C-index correlates most strongly with distance to closest node. Regular star-forming galaxies have spins parallel to filaments, while centrally-concentrated galaxies have spins perpendicular to filaments.

Conclusion: Multi-scale environmental processes (local and large-scale) act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centers, likely via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups.

Abstract: To explore the environmental mechanisms causing quenching in nearby star-forming galaxies, we study the variation with local and large-scale environments of a star formation concentration index, C-index $\equiv\log{(r_{50,{\rm H}α}/r_{50,\rm cont}})$, that traces the spatially-resolved distribution of H$α$ emission. Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups.

TL;DR: Observations of complex carbon-bearing molecules in prestellar core L1544 and protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422 reveal chemical complexity in early star formation, with current astrochemical models underestimating abundances of long cyanopolyynes, suggesting incomplete chemical networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin and growth of complex carbon-bearing molecules in early stages of Sun-like star formation, and determine whether these species contribute to molecular complexity in planetary systems.

Method: Used 100-m Green Bank Telescope observations of prestellar core L1544 and protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422, performed radiative transfer analysis, and conducted astrochemical modeling with an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates.

Result: Detected several complex carbon-bearing species in both sources, found chemical differences (IRAS 16293-2422 shows 10-100 times lower column densities than L1544), and discovered that current models underestimate abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than HC₅N by up to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Current astrochemical models with dominant neutral-neutral formation routes are incomplete; additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for forming long carbon chains, requiring development of more comprehensive chemical networks for accurate interpretation of observations.

Abstract: Astrochemical observations have revealed a surprisingly high level of chemical complexity, including long carbon chains, in the earliest stages of Sun-like star formation. The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. In L1544, we detected several complex carbon-bearing species, including $\mathrm{C_2S}$, $\mathrm{C_3S}$, $\mathrm{C_3N}$, $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$, $\mathrm{C_4H}$, and $\mathrm{C_6H}$, complementing previously reported emission of cyanopolyynes. In IRAS 16293-2422, we detected $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and, for the first time, $\mathrm{HC_7N}$. Thanks to the high spectral resolution, we refine the rest frequencies of several $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and $\mathrm{C_6H}$ transitions. We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations.

*Linlin Li,Shuai Feng,Shiyin Shen,Qi'an Deng,Ying Zu,Wenyuan Cui*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Galaxy interactions in close pairs reduce bar fractions, especially weak bars, with major mergers causing strongest suppression in massive galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how galaxy interactions and tidal perturbations affect bar structures in galaxies by comparing bar fractions in interacting pairs versus isolated galaxies.

Method: Analysis of bar fractions in galaxy pairs from SDSS data, comparing isolated galaxies with close pairs at different projected separations, focusing on systems with merger/disturbance signatures.

Result: Close pairs show significantly reduced bar fractions within 25 kpc, driven by merger systems. Weak bars decrease while strong bars remain unchanged. Suppression strongest in major mergers and massive galaxies, with minor mergers showing weaker suppression only in massive galaxies with small bulges.

Conclusion: Tidal interactions in major mergers suppress bar formation/evolution, particularly weak bars, providing observational evidence for the role of tidal perturbations in regulating bar structures.

Abstract: We investigate the bar fraction in galaxy pairs from the SDSS to assess how galaxy interactions affect bar structures. Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found. These findings provide observational evidence that tidal perturbations in major mergers play a key role in regulating bar evolution.
