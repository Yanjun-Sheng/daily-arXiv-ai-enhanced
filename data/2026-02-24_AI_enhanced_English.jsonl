Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire.

We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023.

We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data.

However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALMA and VLA observations reveal physical structure of ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31: electron temperature 5000-6000 K, density 2500-7500 cm\u207b\u00b3, cometary shape expanding NW, with molecular gas infalling and pressure-confining ionized gas.", "motivation": "Ionized regions around OB-type stars form early in their evolution and are crucial for understanding star formation, but few observations exist of their physical structure and interaction with parental molecular clouds.

Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named \"odd radio circles\" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.", "AI": {"tldr": "Discovery of 18 odd radio circles (ORCs) in LOFAR survey data, including new double-ring and single-ring sources, expanding this rare population and revealing size-spectral index correlations.", "motivation": "Odd radio circles (ORCs) are unusual circular radio sources with unclear origins; increasing their known population and deriving common characteristics could help identify their physical mechanisms.", "method": "Searched LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey DR3 at 144 MHz using parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection; identified optical counterparts and derived redshifts, physical sizes, and spectral indices using additional radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz.", "result": "Isolated 18 sources with ORC structures: 4 double-headed ORCs (two rings, 2 new discoveries), 5 new single-headed ORCs, and 9 candidate ORCs; confirmed association with large elliptical galaxies in most cases; found correlation between physical size and integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.", "conclusion": "ORCs represent a rare and heterogeneous population of radio sources; expanded sample confirms association with large ellipticals and reveals size-spectral index relationship, providing constraints for theoretical models of their origin."}}

Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations.

As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArT\u00e9MiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps.
