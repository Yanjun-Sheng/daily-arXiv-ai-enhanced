### [1] [On the Origin of Coronal Picoflare Jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17796)
*Annu Bura,Daniel Nóbrega-Siverio,Tanmoy Samanta,Jayant Joshi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Solar Orbiter EUV observations reveal tiny coronal jets with bright spires and dark eruptive components, identified as picoflare jets with energies 2-3 orders lower than jetlets, linked to chromospheric surges via flux emergence and reconnection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale jet-like eruptions (picoflare jets, jetlets) are potential contributors to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, but their physical origin remains unclear. The study aims to investigate these phenomena using high-resolution Solar Orbiter data.

Method: Used ultra-high-resolution EUV imaging from Solar Orbiter's EUI to observe tiny coronal jets in polar regions. Analyzed 11 jets in detail, comparing with coordinated IRIS and SDO/AIA data. Performed 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations with Bifrost code to model the observed structures.

Result: Jets exhibit bright spire with dark eruptive component; spatial/temporal scales comparable to jetlets but kinetic energies 2-3 orders lower (picoflare regime). Dark components show lower speeds. Morphological correspondence found between dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges, suggesting flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low heights produce coupled bright-dark structures.

Conclusion: Solar Orbiter can resolve small-scale jet dynamics. The bright-dark jet structures likely originate from flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights, providing a plausible mechanism for picoflare jet generation and new constraints on their origin.

Abstract: Small-scale jet-like eruptions, such as picoflare jets and jetlets, are recognized as potential contributors to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, yet their physical origin is still not fully established. Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire. This association suggests that flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights may produce coupled bright-dark structures, providing a plausible mechanism for the generation of picoflare jets. Our results demonstrate Solar Orbiter's ability to resolve the dynamics of small-scale jets and place new constraints on their origin.

### [2] [Long-term eclipse time variations in white dwarf binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17800)
*Amalie Yates,S. G. Parsons,A. J. Brown,N. Castro Segura,V. S. Dhillon,M. J. Dyer,J. A. Garbutt,M. J. Green,D. Jarvis,M. R. Kennedy,P. Kerry,D. Kilkenny,S. P. Littlefair,J. McCormac,J. Munday,I. Pelisoli,E. Pike,D. I. Sahman*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study of 43 white dwarf binary systems finds eclipse timing variations are likely driven by Applegate/Lanza mechanisms rather than planets, with partially radiative companion stars showing highest variation levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the origin of quasi-periodic eclipse timing variations in white dwarf binary systems, specifically testing between the planetary hypothesis and Applegate/Lanza mechanisms.

Method: Comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems using long-term (decade+) eclipse timing measurements from high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM to track ETV evolution and analyze trends.

Result: Clear difference in ETV levels past the fully convective boundary: systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently show high variation levels. Results strongly indicate Applegate/Lanza mechanisms as the most likely driving force, though these mechanisms still cannot fully reproduce the large, rapid variations observed.

Conclusion: While some systems may have planetary influences, Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are the primary driver of eclipse timing variations in most WD binary systems, particularly those with partially radiative companions, though current models remain insufficient to fully explain the observed variation magnitudes and timescales.

Abstract: The overwhelming majority of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) binary systems show quasi-periodic variations in eclipse timings on many year timescales. Currently, the mechanism behind these eclipse time variations (ETVs) is not known, with the main competing theories being the planetary hypothesis and the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems, the vast majority of which have more than a decade of eclipse timing measurements, analysing their global properties to determine which driving force is the likely origin of the observed ETVs. Long-term, high-speed photometry data obtained with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM have allowed us to track the evolution of the ETVs in these systems, and analyse any previously unseen trends. From this analysis, we find a clear difference in the level of observed ETVs past the fully convective boundary, where systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently showing high levels of variation. While some systems may be affected by the presence of an unknown planet, the results from this study strongly indicates that an Applegate- or Lanza-like mechanism is the most likely driving force for the timing variations seen in the majority of systems in this sample. However, as found in previous studies, the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are still not able to reproduce the large and rapid timing variations seen in the vast majority of systems, with the companion star to the WD unable to provide sufficient energy on these short timescales.

*T. Merle,A. Jorissen,S. Alexandre,J. Desuter,C. Loup,A. Tokovinin,G. Traven,M. Van der Swaelmen,S. Van Eck,G. Van de Steene,J. Southworth,G. Sadowski*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: SB9 is a comprehensive catalogue of ~4000 spectroscopic binaries with orbital parameters, now updated with Gaia DR3 cross-matching and transitioning to SBX with modern database infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an updated, comprehensive compilation of spectroscopic binary orbits after two decades of development, integrate with modern astrometric data from Gaia DR3, and establish a benchmark for binary star research by comparing with Gaia's Non-Single Star catalogue.

Method: Compiled spectroscopic binaries from literature, performed rigorous cross-match with Gaia DR3 using positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation, compared with Gaia NSS catalogue, and analyzed statistical properties through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage.

Result: Final SB9 version contains 4003 systems (2800 single-lined, 1200 double-lined, plus 152 triples, 71 quadruples, 14 higher-order multiples). 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers, 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 highly reliable matches. Limited overlap (20-30%) due to NSS selection criteria. 10 long-period systems spatially resolved by Gaia.

Conclusion: SB9 provides a comprehensive spectroscopic binary catalogue with Gaia DR3 integration, highlighting complementary strengths with Gaia NSS. The work marks SB9's transition to SBX (eXtended Catalogue) with modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community.

Abstract: The Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9) is a comprehensive compilation of spectroscopic binaries (SBs) with orbital parameters sourced from literature, comprising approximately 4000 systems (2800 single-lined and 1200 double-lined). This work presents the latest status of SB9 after two decades of development, detailing the statistical properties of SBs through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage. We performed a rigorous cross-match with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to update astrometric parameters and compare SB9 with the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) catalogue. Our methodology utilized positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation for identification. The final SB9 version updated by D. Pourbaix includes 4003 systems, including higher-order multiples: 152 triples, 71 quadruples, and 14 higher-order systems. Of these, 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers; 21 are too bright and six too faint for detection. Ten SB9 systems with periods exceeding 1180 days were spatially resolved by Gaia DR3. We identified a common sample of 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 considered highly reliable based on period and eccentricity differences under 10%. The limited overlap (20-30% of SB9) results from NSS selection cuts, brightness limits, and temporal baselines. This study highlights the complementary strengths of both catalogues and establishes a benchmark sample for binary star research. Finally, this work marks the transition of SB9 into SBX (The eXtended Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits), featuring a modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory access standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community.

### [4] [Modeling brightness temperature of sunspots using ALMA single-dish observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18069)
*F. Matković,R. Brajša,A. O. Benz,H. -G. Ludwig,C. L. Selhorst,I. Skokić,D. Sudar,A. Hanslmeier*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Researchers modified the ATLCW sunspot model by scaling density and temperature with constant factors to fit ALMA observations, finding sunspots need 3.6-4.0× lower density than original model but 1.4-1.8× higher than quiet Sun, with temperature 1.2× higher than original predictions but lower than quiet Sun.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile discrepancies between observed sunspot brightness temperatures from ALMA (0.3-10mm) and predictions from the 1D semi-empirical ATLCW model. Observations show sunspots are darker than quiet Sun below 2mm but brighter beyond, while the ATLCW model predicts sunspots should be darker across the entire ALMA range.

Method: Modified the existing ATLCW sunspot model by applying constant scaling factors to both density and temperature across all heights. Performed least-square fitting of these scaling parameters to match observed brightness temperature measurements from ALMA single-dish and other instruments in the 0.3-10mm wavelength range.

Result: Best-fit models required sunspot densities 3.6-4.0 times lower than the original ATLCW sunspot model, but 1.4-1.8 times higher than quiet Sun densities. Temperatures were about 1.2 times higher than original ATLCW sunspot predictions, but 1.2 times lower than quiet Sun temperatures. Despite these adjustments, significant discrepancies remained between fitted models and observations.

Conclusion: While scaling density and temperature improved the ATLCW model's agreement with ALMA observations, the remaining discrepancies indicate that more fundamental improvements to the ATLCW model structure and modeling assumptions are necessary to accurately represent sunspot brightness temperature across the millimeter/submillimeter wavelength range.

Abstract: We model sunspot brightness temperature in the wavelength range 0.3-10mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) single-dish measurements together with other instruments. Our modeling idea starts from an existing model, the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-Wülser (ATLCW) model for sunspots. The original model is then modified in density and temperature with a constant factor over all heights. A least-square fit in both density and temperature to the observed values yields an improved model for sunspot brightness temperature. Observations show that sunspots are darker than QS at wavelengths below 2 mm and brighter beyond, while fitting of the ATLCW sunspot model imply that sunspots should be darker than QS over the entireALMArange. The best-fitted sunspot brightness temperature profiles resulted in 3.6-4.0 times lower sunspot density compared to the original sunspot ATLCW model, or 1.4-1.8 times higher density compared to QS. The temperature came out around 1.2 times higher than the original ATLCW predictions for sunspots, or 1.2 times lower than QS temperature. Even with improved density and temperature parameters, the remaining discrepancy between the bestfitted models and observations indicated that additional improvements are needed in the ATLCW model and modeling assumptions.

### [5] [The attempted polarity reversal and evolving magnetic environment of AD Leo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18085)
*K. G. Smith,D. Evensberget,S. Bellotti,J. Morin,A. A. Vidotto,B. J. S. Pope*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of AD Leo's magnetic field evolution shows no polarity reversal but restoration to simpler configuration with increased field strength, affecting stellar wind and habitable zone conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the observed evolution of AD Leo's magnetic field from strongly to mildly negative indicates an impending polarity reversal, and to understand how this evolution affects the space weather environment around this active M dwarf star.

Method: Analyzed spectropolarimetric data from ESPaDOnS and SPIRou instruments (late-2022 to early-2023), computed longitudinal magnetic field from optical and near-infrared data, reconstructed large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging from near-infrared data, and performed 3D Alfven wave-driven stellar wind simulations using the space weather code SWMF with five magnetograms from 2019-2023.

Result: No polarity reversal observed; instead, restoration to simpler configuration with consistently negative longitudinal magnetic field values. New reconstruction shows highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with increased mean large-scale field strength. Stellar mass loss rates are ~10× solar, habitable zone resides beyond Alfven surface, and magnetized habitable zone planets (with field >0.34 G) would be shielded from stellar wind with negligible atmospheric erosion.

Conclusion: AD Leo's magnetic field evolution represents restoration to simpler configuration rather than polarity reversal, with significant implications for space weather and planetary habitability: habitable zone planets with sufficient magnetic fields would be protected from stellar wind erosion despite high mass loss rates.

Abstract: In the past two decades, the observed large-scale magnetic field of the active M dwarf star AD Leo has evolved from strongly to mildly negative, raising a suspicion that it might switch polarity. Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field.

### [6] [3D radiative transfer modeling of scattering polarization with partial frequency redistribution I. Verification and disk-center results for the solar Ca I 4227 Å line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18100)
*Pietro Benedusi,Simone Riva,Tanausú del Pino Alemán,Gioele Janett,Fabio Riva,Jirí Štepán,Rolf Krause,Javier Trujillo Bueno,Luca Belluzzi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: First 3D non-LTE radiative transfer solution for polarized solar resonance lines including scattering polarization and partial frequency redistribution, enabling magnetic field diagnostics in the outer solar atmosphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar resonance lines show linear scattering polarization signals that can probe outer solar atmosphere magnetism, but accurate modeling requires solving 3D non-LTE radiative transfer with partial frequency redistribution effects, which was previously computationally inaccessible.

Method: Developed TRIP software for massively parallel solution of 3D non-LTE radiative transfer for polarized radiation including scattering polarization and PRD. Applied to synthesize Stokes profiles of Ca I 4227 Å line in 3D atmospheric model from radiation MHD simulation, solving large-scale problem with up to 4×10¹⁰ degrees of freedom using preconditioned Krylov method on up to 20,000 CPUs.

Result: Successfully solved previously inaccessible problem, finding that combined PRD effects and 3D atmospheric structure produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in line wings sensitive to magnetic field (via magneto-optical effects) and bulk velocity gradients. CRD approximation underestimates disk-center line-core signal amplitude.

Conclusion: This achievement enables quantitative comparison of synthetic and observational data for diagnosing solar chromosphere and transition region magnetism, representing crucial advancement in solar physics.

Abstract: Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 Å in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data.

### [7] [A Photometric and Spectroscopic investigation of 11 TESS eclipsing contact binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18127)
*Yani Guo,Kai Li,Yanke Tang,Xiang Gao,Qiqi Xia,Liheng Wang,Meng Guo*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of 11 eclipsing binaries from LAMOST cross-match reveals diverse contact configurations, O'Connell effects, orbital period variations, and evolutionary insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain accurate physical parameters and study the evolutionary status of eclipsing binaries by combining LAMOST medium-resolution spectra with light and radial velocity curve analysis.

Method: Cross-matched Prsa et al. (2022) eclipsing binary catalog with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra to obtain 11 targets. Combined light curve and radial velocity curve analysis to derive physical parameters. Used O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis for 10 targets to study orbital period variations.

Result: Identified 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate contact binaries, and 5 shallow contact binaries. Found 3 targets exhibiting O'Connell effect attributed to star-spots. Identified one low-mass ratio deep contact binary as potential merging candidate. O-C analysis revealed: 5 binaries show long-term decreasing orbital periods (mass transfer + angular momentum loss), 4 show increasing periods (mass transfer), and 3 show periodic variations (Applegate mechanism or light travel time effect).

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive physical parameters and evolutionary insights for 11 eclipsing binaries, revealing diverse contact configurations and orbital period variations driven by different physical mechanisms including mass transfer, angular momentum loss, and potential third-body effects.

Abstract: By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog provided by Prsa et al. (2022) with LAMOST medium resolution spectra, we obtained 11 targets. Combining light and radial velocity curves analysis, we have derived accurate physical parameters for these 11 targets. The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect.

### [8] [Power-law Indices of EUV Intensity Power Spectrum in Flaring Coronal Active Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18133)
*Sihui Zhong,Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov,Valery M. Nakariakov*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of coronal EUV intensity power spectra reveals that temporal variations in power-law indices, particularly α_lf, can serve as short-term precursors to solar flares, with significant deviations occurring minutes before flare onset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions, and explore their potential as flare precursors.

Method: Analyzed spatial distribution and temporal evolution of power-law indices (α_lf and α_hf) in coronal EUV intensity power spectra from flare-hosting active regions, examining 14 flare events to quantify temporal variations as potential precursors.

Result: α_lf spatial distribution mirrors EUV intensity images, revealing coronal plasma dynamics. α_lf remains stable in quiescent regions but shows significant variability before flares. In all 14 events, notable α_lf deviations occurred at flare sites minutes before onset. In some cases, α_lf - α_hf changes were detected 30-90 minutes pre-flare.

Conclusion: Temporal variation of power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra shows promise as short-term solar flare precursors, requiring validation on larger flare samples.

Abstract: Solar intensity power spectra are usually characterised by coloured noise, with the spectral energy following a segmented power-law function of frequency, $S(f)\propto f^{-α}$, over different frequency ranges. Typically, the power-law index exceeds 1 in the low-frequency part ($α_\mathrm{lf}$) and is around 0 at high frequencies ($α_\mathrm{hf}$). This work investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions. The spatial distribution of the power-law index in the low-frequency domain ($α_\mathrm{lf}$) closely mirrors EUV intensity images, indicating that $α_\mathrm{lf}$ can reveal the dynamics of coronal plasma structures. Temporally, $α_\mathrm{lf}$ remains stable in quiescent active regions, but it exhibits significant variability before the flare onset. Motivated by this behaviour, we analysed 14 flare events, quantifying the temporal variation of the indices $α_\mathrm{lf}$ and $α_\mathrm{hf}$ as potential flare precursors. In all flare events considered, notable deviations of $α_\mathrm{lf}$ beyond a defined threshold consistently occurred at the flare site within a few minutes before the flare. In some cases, the change in the value of $α_\mathrm{lf} - α_\mathrm{hf}$ was detected within 30--90\, minutes before the flare. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the temporal variation of the power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra could potentially serve as short-term precursors of solar flares, which needs to be validated on a larger flare sample.

### [9] [A method to derive self-consistent NLTE astrophysical parameters for 4 million high-resolution 4MOST stellar spectra in half a day with invertible neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18340)
*Victor F. Ksoll,Nicholas Storm,Maria Bergemann,Katherine Lee,Ralf S. Klessen,R. Albarracín,Guillaume Guiglion,Gražina Tautvaišienė*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A simulation-based deep learning approach using conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) for efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra, achieving accurate parameter recovery with GPU-accelerated processing for large surveys like 4MOST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical spectroscopic methods are computationally expensive and impractical for analyzing millions of stars in modern surveys like 4MOST, requiring more efficient approaches for large-scale stellar parameter and abundance determination.

Method: Used synthetic NLTE spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations, trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict stellar parameters and chemical abundances with full posterior distributions and intrinsic uncertainty estimates.

Result: The cINN achieved average errors of 33 K for Teff, 0.16 dex for log(g), 0.12 dex for [Fe/H], and 0.1-0.51 dex for various elemental abundances at S/N=250. Verified consistency with independent code TSFitPy on benchmark stars, with capability to process 4 million spectra in <1 day using GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: The NLTE cINN approach is robust and efficient, enabling rapid analysis of large-scale spectroscopic surveys like 4MOST while providing accurate stellar parameters and abundances with uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys obtain spectra for millions of stars. However, classical spectroscopic methods can often be computationally expensive, rendering them impractical for the analysis of large datasets. We introduce a novel simulation-based deep-learning approach for the efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra to be obtained with the upcoming high-resolution 4MOST spectrograph. We used a suite of synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations and trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for the purpose of predicting self-consistently stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances. The cINN is a neural network architecture that estimates full posterior distributions for the target stellar properties, providing an intrinsic uncertainty estimate. We evaluated the predictive performance of the trained cINN model on both synthetic data and observed spectra of stars. We found that our new cINN trained on NLTE synthetic spectra is capable of recovering stellar parameters with average errors ($σ$) of $33$ K for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $0.16$ dex for $\log(g)$, and $0.12$ dex for [Fe/H], $0.1$ dex for [Ca/Fe], $0.11$ for [Mg/Fe], and $0.51$ dex for [Li/Fe], respectively, at a signal to noise ratio of 250 per Angstrom. From the analysis of the observed spectra of Gaia-ESO / 4MOST / PLATO benchmark stars, we verified that our NLTE estimates for stellar parameters and abundances are consistent with results obtained with the independent code TSFitPy. We conclude that the NLTE cINN is robust and can, theoretically, evaluate 4 million high-resolution 4MOST spectra in less than a day, using GPU acceleration.

### [10] [Teen TITANS simulations -- I. Inefficient intermediate-mass black hole seeding via stellar collisions in young massive clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17762)
*Benedetta Mestichelli,Sara Rastello,Michela Mapelli,Manuel Arca Sedda,Marica Branchesi*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Direct N-body simulations show repeated stellar collisions in young massive clusters are inefficient at forming intermediate-mass black hole seeds due to pair-instability supernovae, with most very massive stars forming via primordial binary mergers rather than collision chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether repeated stellar collisions in young massive clusters can efficiently produce very massive stars and viable seeds for intermediate-mass black holes, given that YMCs provide environments conducive to frequent stellar interactions.

Method: Used TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct N-body simulations spanning cluster masses 10^5-10^6 M⊙ and half-mass densities 100-10^5 M⊙ pc^{-3}, including high primordial binary fractions consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters.

Result: Repeated collisions only occur in densest clusters (ρ_h > 500 M⊙ pc^{-3}, t_rh < 1.3 Gyr); most VMSs form via primordial binary mergers (m_* < 300 M⊙) rather than collision chains; only three VMSs reached >330 M⊙ via repeated collisions; none constitute viable IMBH seeds due to pair-instability; five IMBHs formed from stellar collisions, but twelve formed via stellar-mass black hole mergers.

Conclusion: For typical local YMC properties, stellar collision chains are inefficient at producing IMBHs more massive than 140 M⊙, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses in the pair-instability regime, preventing black hole seed formation.

Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $ρ_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $ρ_{\rm h}<500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}>1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.

Motivation: Observations show star-forming cores in filaments with separations smaller than the theoretical minimum predicted by linear perturbation theory, creating a discrepancy between theory and observations that needs explanation.

Method: Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using the Ramses code to track evolution of initial perturbations within filaments, comparing measured growth rates to theoretical models and analyzing non-linear evolution effects.

Result: Non-linear evolution begins when core mass reaches a point where gravitational potential shifts from cylindrical filament potential to spherical Bonnor-Ebert sphere potential. Core collapse is triggered by loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere rather than the filament. Maximum core mass is determined by filament pressure, establishing a constant line-mass threshold for collapse.

Conclusion: Cores forming as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can undergo direct collapse even with separations smaller than linear perturbation theory predictions, explaining the observed discrepancy between theory and observations.

Abstract: Star formation within filaments may arise due to the growth of cores according to linear perturbation theory. This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at z~0.7 show moderate CO excitation with little star formation, indicating suppressed star formation efficiency rather than hidden starbursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-starburst galaxies retain molecular gas but have low star formation, raising questions about gas efficiency and potential hidden star formation during early post-burst phases.

Method: ALMA CO(5-4) observations of 9 gas-rich post-starburst galaxies from SQuIGGLE survey, combined with existing CO(2-1) data to analyze molecular gas excitation via r52 ratio.

Result: 8/9 targets detected CO(5-4); most show moderate excitation (r52≈0.1-0.3) with no clear correlation between excitation and star formation rate/density. All have ΣSFR~0.01-1 M⊙ yr⁻¹ kpc⁻². One AGN host shows elevated excitation (r52≈0.6).

Conclusion: Gas-rich post-starbursts have moderately excited molecular gas alongside modest star formation, indicating suppressed star formation efficiencies rather than strong buried starburst activity.

Abstract: Many post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ have been shown to retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs yet host low ongoing star formation, suggesting that the remaining gas may be inefficient at forming stars during the early post-burst phase. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(5-4) observations of nine gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, angu$\vec{L}$ar momentum, and Evolution (SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E) survey, providing a view of the molecular gas excitation in these systems. Combined with existing CO(2-1) data, we detect CO(5-4) in 8/9 targets and find that most have moderate CO excitation with $r_{52}\equiv L'_{\rm CO(5-4)}/L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}\approx0.1-0.3$. These systems show no clear trend between $r_{52}$ and either total or surface-density of star formation. Specifically, all objects have $Σ_{\mathrm{SFR}} \sim 0.01-1\ \text{M}_\odot\ \text{yr}^{-1}\ \text{kpc}^{-2}$, consistent with compact, modest star formation, even when allowing for buried activity, as these galaxies decline from their peak. One object J1448+1010, which has clear optical, mid-infrared, and radio indicators of an active galactic nucleus, is an outlier with $r_{52}\approx0.6$; its elevated excitation likely requires significant non-stellar heating, with a contribution from potentially obscured star formation. Together, most gas-rich SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E post-starbursts have moderately excited molecular gas alongside little to modest star-forming activity, indicating that the remaining gas hosts relatively suppressed star formation efficiencies instead of strong buried starburst activity.

TL;DR: JWST study detects neutral gas outflows in 57% of massive quiescent galaxies at z~3.5 using NaI absorption, revealing outflow properties similar to local galaxies and suggesting feedback-regulated quenching rather than permanent gas removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of neutral gas outflows in the baryon cycle of galaxies and their connection to the transition from star formation to quiescence, particularly in massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift (z~3.5).

Method: Analyzed 23 massive quiescent galaxies (M⋆ = 10¹⁰·¹-¹¹·⁶ M⊙) at z=2.82-4.61 using JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam data from DeepDive program. Traced neutral gas outflows via NaI Doublet absorption lines, detected blueshifted absorption in 7/23 targets. Derived mass outflow rates and compared with local counterparts in SFR-Δv space.

Result: Detected excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, with 7/23 (30%) showing blueshifted absorption (|Δv| ≳ 150 km/s). Outflow velocities similar to local counterparts. Identified extreme neutral gas outflow rate of log(Ṁout/M⊙ yr⁻¹) = 2.68±0.27, coincident with X-ray AGN. All NaI D detected systems occupy LI(N)ER region of BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but no strong correlation with ongoing AGN activity.

Conclusion: Neutral outflows alone cannot permanently quench star formation by removing gas in z~3.5 galaxies. Instead, gas cycling in/out of massive passive systems suggests feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes, with outflows likely recycling on short timescales (3-180 Myr) rather than escaping host galaxies.

Abstract: Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|Δv|$ >~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have $Δv$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--$Δv$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.

*Veselina Kalinova,Keiichi Kodaira,Dario Colombo*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Galaxy evolution study using three classification schemes reveals tight connection between morphology, gravitational potential, and star formation quenching across Hubble types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand galaxy evolution and transitions between morphologies by analyzing the relationship between star formation rate and stellar mass using multiple classification approaches.

Method: Analyzed 231 galaxies from CALIFA survey using three classification schemes: Hubble classification (structure), circular velocity curve classification via PCA (gravitational potential), and Quenching classification from Hα equivalent width maps (spatial quenching patterns).

Result: Clear separation on SFR-M* plane: late-type spirals with slow-rising velocity curves dominate blue cloud; early-type spirals with flat/round-peaked curves populate green valley; ellipticals/lenticulars with round/sharp-peaked curves reside on red sequence. Morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 have unique QS and velocity curve characteristics.

Conclusion: Tight link exists between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and star formation suppression, with different morphological groups occupying distinct evolutionary stages on the SFR-M* plane.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into galaxy evolution and the mechanisms driving transitions between different galaxy morphologies, we analyse the connection between star formation rate and stellar mass for 231 galaxies spanning Hubble types E1-Sdm from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy Area survey using three complementary classification schemes. The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Bayesian analysis of UMa III/U1 kinematics finds no significant rotation signal, preferring non-rotating model 5-12× over rotating model, suggesting system is not rotationally supported.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determine whether UMa III/U1 is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) or star cluster by measuring intrinsic rotation, which affects total mass estimates and classification.

Method: Bayesian inference comparing non-rotating vs. rotational models for member stars; analysis performed on both total population and reduced population with contaminants removed.

Result: Non-rotating model preferred by factor ~5-12×; lower-bound mass-to-light ratio of 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} M⊙/L⊙; no evidence for rotational support.

Conclusion: UMa III/U1 remains ambiguous between UFD and star cluster scenarios, but under both possibilities, it is unlikely to be supported by rotational pressure.

Abstract: We investigate the kinematics of the potential ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) UMa III/U1 using Bayesian inference to search for the signal of any potential intrinsic rotation. The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\sim 5-12 \times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations. We calculate a lower-bound rotational mass estimate for UMa III/U1 and a corresponding lower bound mass-to-light ratio of $ 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \mathrm{M_\odot} / \mathrm{L_\odot} $ for the total population. We conclude that UMa III/U1 still remains an ambiguous object with viable arguments for both the UFD and self-gravitating star cluster scenarios, however under both, UMa III/U1 is unlikely to be supported by rotational pressure.

TL;DR: Wideband L-band VLA survey of Perseus molecular cloud detects 1410 radio sources and 205 polarized background sources, enabling improved mapping of magnetic field structure through rotation measure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component in the Perseus molecular cloud using enhanced radio polarization measurements, addressing limitations of previous NVSS-based surveys.

Method: Used Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array wideband L-band observations covering ~13.8 deg² with mean Stokes I sensitivity of ~80 μJy beam⁻¹. Applied RM Synthesis and RM CLEAN techniques to detect polarized sources and measure rotation measures.

Result: Detected 1410 compact radio sources and 205 polarized background sources above 8σ threshold (sampling density ~14.8 deg⁻², >10× improvement over NVSS). Majority show negative spectral indices (non-thermal synchrotron). Rotation measures reveal coherent large-scale variations with small-scale structure.

Conclusion: Enhanced sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sampling density enable substantially improved mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component toward Perseus molecular cloud compared to previous surveys.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive radio polarization study of the Perseus molecular cloud using wideband L-band observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our survey covers $\sim13.8$~deg$^2$ with a mean Stokes~$I$ sensitivity of $\sim80~μ$Jy~beam$^{-1}$, enabling the detection of 1410 compact radio sources. From this population, we construct a catalog of source properties, including positions, integrated flux densities, and spectral indices measured across nine spectral windows. The majority of sources exhibit negative spectral indices, consistent with non-thermal synchrotron emission. Using RM Synthesis and RM CLEAN techniques, we detect 205 polarized background sources above an $8σ$ threshold. This corresponds to a sampling density of $\sim14.8$~deg$^{-2}$, representing more than an order-of-magnitude increase compared to previous NVSS-based measurements. The resulting rotation measures exhibit coherent large-scale variations across the surveyed region, with additional small-scale structure superimposed. The enhanced sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sampling density of our observations enable a substantially improved mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component toward the Perseus molecular cloud compared to previous surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Gas-rich UDG MATLAS-42 shows recent star formation, contradicting the "failed galaxy" formation pathway typically associated with GC-rich cluster UDGs, suggesting it's not a progenitor of such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether gas-rich, GC-rich UDGs follow the same "failed galaxy" formation pathway as passive GC-rich cluster UDGs, using MATLAS-42 as a case study to understand UDG formation diversity.

Method: Used Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy to measure redshift and stellar population properties of MATLAS-42, derived mass-weighted age and metallicity, and built toy models of passive evolution to track GC-richness over time.

Result: MATLAS-42 is young (3.2 Gyr mass-weighted age), low-metallicity ([M/H] = -1.19 dex), and has experienced recent star formation. Its GC-richness will decrease over time as GCs disrupt, making it unlikely to evolve into a "failed galaxy" UDG.

Conclusion: MATLAS-42 does not follow the "failed galaxy" formation pathway; it represents a different evolutionary track with recent star formation, suggesting diversity in UDG formation mechanisms beyond the cluster environment paradigm.

Abstract: To date, there has been significant interest in globular cluster (GC)-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and the evidence that they have formed via an unexpected, ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway. The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\rm R, \star}=2433\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\rm R,HI}=2423\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\rm GC}/M_\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs.

TL;DR: JWST study finds merger fraction stable from z=0-8 (~5% major, ~13% major+minor), but merger rate increases strongly from z=1-7. High-z mergers enhance SFR by factor 1.7 but contribute only 5-10% to total mass growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution of galaxy merger frequency and properties in the early Universe (z>5), which remains poorly constrained despite extensive local Universe studies.

Method: Analyzed 1233 galaxies at 5<z<14 with JWST imaging using morphological parameters (Gini, M-20, Asymmetry) to identify mergers. Performed SED modeling with HST+JWST photometry to derive stellar masses and SFRs using non-parametric star-formation histories.

Result: Merger fraction stable from z=0-8 (~5% major, ~13% major+minor). Merger rate increases >1 dex from z=1-7. At 5<z<10: ~2 major mergers/galaxy/Gyr. Mergers enhance SFR by factor 1.7 but contribute only 5-10% to total mass growth.

Conclusion: Mergers play a significant but quantitatively limited role in early galaxy evolution - they trigger short-lived star-formation bursts but contribute modestly to overall mass assembly at z>5.

Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.

TL;DR: HI surveys identify gas-rich LSBGs missed in optical searches, with most meeting UDG criteria and showing normal baryonic Tully-Fisher relation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the population of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) using complementary HI and optical surveys, understanding why HI-identified LSBGs are often missed in optical searches, and characterizing their properties.

Method: Used MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and public optical LSBG catalogs; performed surface brightness photometry on HI detections to identify LSBGs; extracted HI spectra at optical galaxy locations to place upper limits on HI-to-stellar mass ratios; analyzed colors, sizes, and kinematics.

Result: Found 29 HI-identified LSBGs, 26 meeting UDG criteria (R_eff > 1.5 kpc); minimal overlap (3 galaxies) between HI and optical samples; HI-identified LSBGs are bluer and gas-rich; most overlap in surface brightness, size, and color with optical samples; 3/4 HI-selected UDGs align with baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

Conclusion: HI surveys are valuable for discovering and characterizing gas-rich LSBGs missed in optical searches, with most identified galaxies meeting UDG criteria and showing normal kinematic properties, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength approaches for studying the low surface brightness universe.

Abstract: Untargeted neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys are well suited to identifying low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) that are gas rich, and they offer a complementary view to optically selected populations. We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA and VLA observations reveal physical structure of ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31: electron temperature 5000-6000 K, density 2500-7500 cm⁻³, cometary shape expanding NW, with molecular gas infalling and pressure-confining ionized gas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ionized regions around OB-type stars form early in their evolution and are crucial for understanding star formation, but few observations exist of their physical structure and interaction with parental molecular clouds. New instruments like ALMA and upgraded VLA provide the resolution and sensitivity needed to study these regions.

Method: Used ALMA full-band 3 mm observations from GUAPOS project to image multiple hydrogen recombination lines and molecular transitions tracing medium-density gas (10⁴-10⁶ cm⁻³). Complemented with VLA continuum measurements at 1 cm and 7 mm. Applied non-LTE model fitting to analyze density, temperature structure, and velocity field.

Result: Electron temperature of HII region ranges 5000-6000 K, density varies 2500-7500 cm⁻³. Parameter distribution and velocity field suggest cometary-shaped HII region expanding NW away from observer. Molecular gas is infalling toward UC HII region peak, with density and temperature consistent with pressure confinement of ionized gas to SE.

Conclusion: The study provides detailed physical characterization of G31.41+0.31, revealing its cometary morphology, expansion direction, and ongoing interaction with infalling molecular material. Results demonstrate the power of ALMA/VLA combined observations for probing early-stage OB star formation environments.

Abstract: Ionised regions around OB-type stars are formed at an early stage of their evolution and are important to investigate the formation process of these objects. However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.

Method: Searched LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey DR3 at 144 MHz using parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection; identified optical counterparts and derived redshifts, physical sizes, and spectral indices using additional radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz.

Result: Isolated 18 sources with ORC structures: 4 double-headed ORCs (two rings, 2 new discoveries), 5 new single-headed ORCs, and 9 candidate ORCs; confirmed association with large elliptical galaxies in most cases; found correlation between physical size and integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.

Conclusion: ORCs represent a rare and heterogeneous population of radio sources; expanded sample confirms association with large ellipticals and reveals size-spectral index relationship, providing constraints for theoretical models of their origin.

Abstract: Deep radio surveys are now producing catalogues with millions of radio sources. Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named "odd radio circles" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The G316.8 filament shows an evolutionary sequence from young IRDC to evolved HII region, with increasing fragment masses, dense gas fractions, and structural changes in N-PDFs and Δ-variance slopes, revealing ongoing dense structure assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand massive star and cluster formation through a dynamic view of mass assembly, requiring careful control of distance and environmental variations that can be achieved by studying the G316.8 filament as an ideal laboratory with contiguous subregions spanning different evolutionary stages.

Method: Mapped the 14-pc G316.8 filament with Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm (0.08 pc resolution), combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data to derive high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. Analyzed structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and Δ-variance analysis.

Result: From young to evolved regions: maximum fragment mass increased from 8 to 490 M⊙; dense-gas mass fraction (>0.5 g cm⁻²) rose from 0.4% to 9.6%; N-PDF developed secondary power-law tail; Δ-variance slope became progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures.

Conclusion: The G316.8 filament provides clear evidence of evolutionary progression in massive star formation, with systematic changes in structural properties that reveal ongoing assembly of dense structures, and future ALMA data will extend this dynamic scenario to 800 AU scales.

Abstract: A dynamic view of mass assembly is essential for understanding the formation of massive stars and clusters. Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations. The G316.8 filament provides an ideal laboratory: a 14-pc nearly linear structure composed of three contiguous subregions with comparable molecular gas reservoirs (~10,000 $M_\odot$ each) but spanning a clear evolutionary sequence from an infrared dark cloud (young) through a massive young stellar object (intermediate) to an HII region (evolved). As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $Δ$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%. The N-PDF develops a secondary power-law tail and the $Δ$-variance slope becomes progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures. Our further ALMA 12m continuum and spectral line data will extend this dynamic scenarios down to 800 AU scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IFS surveys provide unique spatial-spectroscopic data that could reveal new insights into galaxy evolution, but require advanced methods to extract generalized feature representations across both dimensions.

Method: Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network Autoencoders to encode generalized feature representations across spatial and spectroscopic dimensions, analyzing 19 optical emission lines (3800-8000Å) from ~9000 MaNGA galaxies.

Conclusion: The unsupervised deep learning approach effectively extracts meaningful features from IFS data and identifies scientifically relevant anomalies, demonstrating potential for discovering new insights in galaxy evolution studies.

Abstract: Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys offer a unique new landscape in which to learn in both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions and could help uncover previously unknown insights into galaxy evolution. In this work, we demonstrate a new unsupervised deep learning framework using Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network Autoencoders to encode generalized feature representations across both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions spanning $19$ optical emission lines (3800A $< λ<$ 8000A) among a sample of $\sim 9000$ galaxies from the MaNGA IFS survey. As a demonstrative exercise, we assess our model on a sample of $290$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and highlight scientifically interesting characteristics of some highly anomalous AGN.
