This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\u0394g \\sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\\rm trigger} \\simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\\sim5-12.3 R_\\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\\rm acc}\\sim10^{-5} M_\\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir.

A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "A neural network approach is developed to accelerate dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies, achieving significant speed improvements over traditional Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) while maintaining accuracy.", "motivation": "Traditional dynamical modeling methods make unrealistic assumptions about galaxy geometry, velocity ellipsoid shape, and stellar distribution.

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.", "AI": {"tldr": "First spectroscopic census of Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites (UFCSs) reveals they are kinematically colder than ultra-faint dwarfs, chemically diverse, and potentially include the smallest galaxies yet discovered.", "motivation": "Little is known about the nature and origins of compact, extremely-low-mass stellar systems discovered in Milky Way halo due to lack of spectroscopic measurements.", "method": "Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs (\u223c2/3 of known population), measuring radial velocities, velocity dispersions, metallicities, metallicity dispersions, and Gaia-based proper motions.", "result": "UFCSs are kinematically colder than UFDs, chemically diverse (spanning \u223c300\u00d7 in iron abundance), with some falling below GC metallicity floor; up to 50% may be smallest galaxies discovered.", "conclusion": "UFCS population includes both star clusters and potentially the smallest, least-massive galaxies yet discovered, challenging traditional classification boundaries."}}
