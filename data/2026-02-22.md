*Scott Carlsten,Jiaxuan Li,Jenny Greene,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Shany Danieli*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ELVES-Field survey identifies 95 Local Volume dwarf galaxies, including 44 isolated ones, using semi-automated detection and multiple distance measurement techniques to study field dwarf populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study the field dwarf galaxy population in the Local Volume (D < 10 Mpc) and understand small-scale structure and environmental effects on dwarf galaxy evolution.

Method: Semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarf detection over ~3,000 square degrees, with confirmation via multiple distance measurement techniques (redshift, tip of the red giant branch, surface brightness fluctuations) and environmental criteria to identify isolated field dwarfs.

Result: Detected and confirmed 95 Local Volume dwarfs, 44 of which are isolated; survey is 50% complete to m_g~20 mag and M_*~10^6 M_sun; field dwarf mass function shows good agreement with previous redshift surveys and IllustrisTNG simulations at high-mass end.

Conclusion: The ELVES-Field survey provides a powerful dataset of isolated field dwarfs for investigating small-scale structure and environmental effects on dwarf galaxy evolution, with mass function consistent with simulations and previous observations.

Abstract: We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.

### [2] [Interstellar Formation of Thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS). Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17551)
*N. Rani,S. Vogt-Geisse,S. Bovino*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Study explores formation mechanisms of thioethanal (CH₃CHS) from thioethanol precursor in interstellar environments, identifying barrierless gas-phase pathways and surface-modulated reactions on water ice, with implications for sulfur chemistry in molecular clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in interstellar medium, particularly thioethanal (CH₃CHS) from thioethanol precursor, and gain insights into sulfur budget in cold molecular clouds where mutual exclusive detections of CH₃CH₂SH and CH₃CHS have been observed in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N).

Method: Employed electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments. Used medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters to mimic interstellar ice-mantles as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. Investigated Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways.

Result: Identified barrierless formation mechanism for CH₃CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions in gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in site-specific manner. Found competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH₃CH(SH)SH) on ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH₃CHS yields. Reported first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice, confirming greater volatility than ethanol.

Conclusion: Proposed mechanism offers tentative hypothesis for apparent mutual exclusive detections of CH₃CH₂SH and CH₃CHS in observed regions. Findings highlight multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in interstellar medium and support CH₃CH(SH)SH as promising astrochemical target. Requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling to distinguish chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations.

Abstract: The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.

### [3] [ELVES-Field: Isolated Dwarf Galaxy Quenched Fractions Rise Below $M_* \approx 10^7$ $M_\odot$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16778)
*Scott Carlsten,Jiaxuan Li,Jenny Greene,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Shany Danieli*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ELVES-Field survey reveals star formation properties and sizes of isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, showing that at low masses ($M_* < 10^7 M_\odot$), ~30% of field dwarfs are quenched, and isolated dwarfs are ~20% smaller than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, particularly focusing on low-mass isolated systems, and understand how environment affects dwarf galaxy evolution.

Method: Used a new sample of low-mass isolated galaxies from ELVES-Field survey, covering nearly 3,000 square degrees with volume-limited selection using surface brightness fluctuations for distance measurements. Selected isolated dwarfs based on environmental criteria (>2×R_vir from any known group with M_* > 10^9 M_\odot). Cataloged over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, confirmed 95 as genuine members, rejected 1600 as background contaminants.

Result: At higher dwarf masses (M_* ≳ 10^7 M_⊙), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming. At lower masses (M_* ≲ 10^7 M_⊙), ~30% of field dwarfs appear quenched. Isolated dwarfs are ~20% smaller than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.

Conclusion: Environment significantly affects dwarf galaxy properties: isolation leads to smaller sizes compared to satellites, and a substantial fraction of low-mass field dwarfs can be quenched, challenging previous assumptions about star formation in isolated environments.

Abstract: We use a new sample of low-mass ($M_* < 10^9$ $M_\odot$) isolated galaxies from the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field) to examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc). This volume-limited sample was selected from nearly 3,000 square degrees of imaging, relying on surface brightness fluctuations to determine distances to the majority of the systems and is complete to $M_* \approx 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Across the surveyed area, we catalog over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, of which we confirm 95 as genuine LV members and reject over 1600 as background contaminants, with the remaining 600 candidates still requiring a distance measurement. Of the confirmed LV dwarfs, 46 are either new discoveries or confirmed via a distance measurement for the first time here. We explore different environmental criteria to select isolated dwarfs but primarily focus on dwarfs that are $>2\times R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in projection from any known group with $M_\star > 10^9$ $M_\odot$. We find that, at higher dwarf masses ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\odot$), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming as has been found before. In contrast, at $M_\star \lesssim 10^7$ $M_\odot$, $\sim30\%$ of field dwarfs appear to be quenched. Finally, we find that isolated dwarfs are noticeably smaller ($\sim 20\%$) than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.

### [4] [Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual Subkiloparsec AGN (VODKA): Three Quadruply Lensed Quasars at Cosmic Noon in HST and JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16995)
*Mingrui Liu,Yu-Ching Chen,Nadia L. Zakamska,Xin Liu,Yue Shen,Xuheng Ding,Arran Gross,Hsiang-Chih Hwang,Yuzo Ishikawa,Kedar A. Phadke*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: HST and JWST observations of three quadruply lensed quasars reveal early-type lensing galaxies with small Einstein radii (0.44"-0.58") and intermediate-to-high redshifts, representing an unexplored population of subarcsecond-separation lenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize an understudied population of strong gravitational lenses with subarcsecond separations and understand the properties of lensing galaxies at intermediate-to-high redshifts.

Method: Used HST and JWST imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars at z=2.550, 2.975, and 1.500. Modeled lensing galaxies with singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profiles and elliptical Sérsic light profiles to reconstruct geometric configurations and constrain lens redshifts.

Result: Measured Einstein radii of 0.44", 0.58", and 0.49". Constrained lens redshifts to 0.5<z<1.2, 1.0<z<1.5, and 0.4<z<0.9. Best-fit models show de Vaucouleurs profiles (n~4) with effective radii ~1.5-3.5 kpc, classifying lenses as early-type galaxies at intermediate-to-high redshifts.

Conclusion: These lenses represent an unexplored quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in single-galaxy strong lensing populations, with small Einstein radii and relatively high lens redshifts, making them valuable targets for future high-resolution lensing surveys.

Abstract: We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic} \sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.

### [5] [PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: VII. (Complex) organic molecules in the NGC1333 IRAS4B1 outflow: A new laboratory for shock chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17177)
*Laura A. Busch,J. E. Pineda,P. Caselli,D. M. Segura-Cox,S. Narayanan,C. Gieser,M. J. Maureira,T. -H. Hsieh,Y. Lin,M. T. Valdivia-Mena,L. Bouscasse,Th. Henning,D. Semenov,A. Fuente,Y. -R. Chou,L. Mason,P. C. Cortés,L. W. Looney,I. W. Stephens,M. Tafalla,A. Dutrey,W. Kwon,P. Saha*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: First detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 protostellar outflow, revealing it as a promising new laboratory for studying shock chemistry and COM formation/destruction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To map COM emission and characterize the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1, establishing it as a new laboratory for studying shock chemistry's impact on COM formation and destruction mechanisms.

Method: Used PRODIGE large program data to map COM emission, analyze integrated intensity ratios between molecules (CH3OH vs. DCN, D2CO, CH3CHO), create intensity ratio maps (HC3N/CH3OH, CH3CN/CH3OH), derive rotational temperatures (~50-100 K) from two positions (one per lobe), and compare abundances with L1157-B1 reference outflow.

Result: First secure detection of COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in IRAS 4B1 outflow. Found emission from typical outflow tracers (SiO, CO), H2CO, HNCO, HC3N, and deuterated species (DCN, D2CO, CH2DOH). Identified gradients in molecular intensity ratios with distance from protostar, with HC3N/CH3OH and CH3CN/CH3OH ratios peaking in warmer southern lobe. Abundances relative to CH3OH are several times higher than in L1157-B1.

Conclusion: IRAS 4B1 outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry studies. Morphological differences between molecules and relative abundances provide first evidence that targeted observations will enable discovery of new COMs and detailed analysis of COM formation/destruction mechanisms, outflow structure, and kinematics.

Abstract: Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.

### [6] [MIDIS: The identification of deep MIRI-red sources as candidates for extreme Balmer-break and line emitting galaxies at high-z](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17329)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: MIDIS survey identifies rare MIRI-red galaxies with extreme emission lines or high-redshift Balmer breaks, finding fewer than expected from luminosity function extrapolations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the detection and nature of rare 5.6μm MIRI-red sources in the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of high-redshift galaxy populations.

Method: Used MIDIS survey data covering 2.4 arcmin² in HUDF with 5σ detection threshold at 5.6μm; defined MIRI-red sources as those with m_F444W - m_F560W ≥ 0.5; applied empirical methodology to estimate purity/completeness; identified candidates and explored physical origins through emission line equivalent widths and Balmer break analysis.

Result: Found 92% purity and 54% completeness at 28.75 mag; identified 7 MIRI-red galaxy candidates including an F115W dropout; determined MIRI-red galaxies consistent with extreme emission-line galaxies (EW₀(Hα) ≥ 750Å or EW₀(Hβ+[OIII]) ≥ 600Å) or high-redshift Balmer breaks ≥1.6; discovered extreme MIRI-red galaxy with EW₀(Hα) ∼6000Å; found fewer detections than expected from line luminosity function extrapolations.

Conclusion: MIRI-red sources in MIDIS represent rare galaxy populations with extreme emission lines or high-redshift Balmer breaks; the survey depth reveals fewer such objects than predicted by luminosity function extrapolations, consistent with previous deep searches and theoretical expectations for the survey volume.

Abstract: We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6~μm MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4~arcmin$^2$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$σ$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\% and completeness of 54\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(Hα) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) \ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(Hα) \sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) \sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$α$ or H$β$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.

### [7] [Dynamical Modelling of Galactic Kinematics using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17371)
*David A. Simon,Michele Cappellari,Shude Mao,Jiani Chu,Dandan Xu*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A neural network approach is developed to accelerate dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies, achieving significant speed improvements over traditional Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dynamical modeling methods make unrealistic assumptions about galaxy geometry, velocity ellipsoid shape, and stellar distribution. Machine learning offers potential for more flexible and efficient modeling approaches, but requires investigation of suitable architectures for this specific task.

Method: Constructed a training set of dynamical models for early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM). Trained neural networks using JAM parameters and mock photometry as inputs, testing various architectures to identify optimal configurations for dynamical modeling.

Result: Successfully modeled JAM galaxies with relatively simple neural network architectures, achieving accurate results with significant computational speed improvements compared to traditional JAM modeling.

Conclusion: Machine learning architectures show promise for accelerating dynamical modeling of galaxies while maintaining accuracy, providing a foundation for developing more sophisticated, assumption-free modeling methods in the future.

Abstract: The advent of integral field data has revolutionised the study of galaxy evolution. A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.

*Sayak Dutta,Sowgat Muzahid,Joop Schaye,Sean Johnson,Edmund Christian Herenz,Ismael Pessa,Ramona Augustin,Nicolas F. Bouché,Joey Braspenning,Sebastiano Cantalupo,Sourav Das,Martin Wendt*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Study of azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI gas in CGM of 113 isolated galaxies shows bimodal distribution (disk plane and polar directions) for low-mass galaxies but not for high-mass galaxies, with O VI kinematics retaining memory of origin site.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the azimuthal dependence and spatial distribution of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium of isolated galaxies, and understand how these distributions vary with galaxy mass and orientation relative to the host galaxy.

Method: Analyzed 113 isolated galaxies (0.12 < z < 0.75) including 91 new measurements from MUSEQuBES survey. Used H I covering fraction within virial radius with threshold log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5 and O VI covering fraction with threshold log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0. Examined azimuthal angle dependence relative to galaxy orientation. Applied halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF) to analyze O VI kinematics.

Result: Low-mass galaxies (7 < log10(M*/Msun) < 9) show enhanced H I covering fraction along both disk plane (phi < 20°) and polar direction (phi > 70°). Higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3) show no such bimodal distribution. O VI shows similar tentative enhancement along major/minor axes for low-mass galaxies but uniform distribution for high-mass galaxies. O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along disk plane compared to polar directions.

Conclusion: The isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties, while O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin. Low-mass galaxies exhibit azimuthally dependent CGM structure with bimodal gas distribution.

Abstract: We investigate the azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 113 isolated galaxies in the redshift range 0.12 < z < 0.75, including 91 new measurements from the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: First spectroscopic census of Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites (UFCSs) reveals they are kinematically colder than ultra-faint dwarfs, chemically diverse, and potentially include the smallest galaxies yet discovered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little is known about the nature and origins of compact, extremely-low-mass stellar systems discovered in Milky Way halo due to lack of spectroscopic measurements.

Method: Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs (∼2/3 of known population), measuring radial velocities, velocity dispersions, metallicities, metallicity dispersions, and Gaia-based proper motions.

Result: UFCSs are kinematically colder than UFDs, chemically diverse (spanning ∼300× in iron abundance), with some falling below GC metallicity floor; up to 50% may be smallest galaxies discovered.

Conclusion: UFCS population includes both star clusters and potentially the smallest, least-massive galaxies yet discovered, challenging traditional classification boundaries.

Abstract: Deep, wide-area photometric surveys have uncovered a population of compact ($r_{1/2} \approx$ 1-15 pc), extremely-low-mass ($M_* \approx$ 20-4000 $M_{\odot}$) stellar systems in the Milky Way halo that are smaller in size than known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) and substantially fainter than most classical globular clusters (GCs). Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of "Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\rm -3.3 \lesssim [Fe/H] \lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the "metallicity floor" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.

TL;DR: Review paper on using NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory data to study the solar-stellar connection, bridging solar physics to understand magnetic activity and atmospheric heating in distant stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage detailed solar observations from SDO to understand magnetic activity and atmospheric heating processes in stars, bridging the gap between solar physics and stellar astrophysics.

Method: Integrating spatially resolved solar observations from SDO's three instruments (HMI, AIA, EVE) into disk-integrated datasets to create Sun-as-a-star studies that can be applied to stellar observations.

Result: Key results include characterization of active regions, quantification of universal heating relationships, and reconstruction of stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra from solar data.

Conclusion: SDO-based studies advance understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar frameworks to diverse stellar populations.

Abstract: The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Gaia24ccy is a peculiar young stellar system with two nearly identical stars that exhibited two similar outbursts in 2019 and 2024, showing unique characteristics unlike known EXor sources, suggesting a hybrid thermal-viscous and magnetospheric compression mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects are poorly understood due to limited observational data. Studying individual outbursting systems like Gaia24ccy is crucial for advancing our understanding of these phenomena.

Method: Analysis of Gaia24ccy's two outbursts (2019 and 2024) using periodogram analyses to identify the outbursting component, examination of photometric evolution, timescales, and mid-infrared color evolution, and modeling of unstable regions and accreted mass.

Result: Gaia24ccy B is identified as the outbursting component. Both outbursts showed similar evolution: rapid rise for 15 days followed by multiple 'sub-bursts' on 10-20 day timescales. The unstable region is located at 0.019-0.047 au (~5-12.3 stellar radii). Accreted mass per event is ~10⁻⁵ M☉, consistent with a compact inner-disk reservoir. Observations favor a hybrid thermal-viscous trigger with concurrent magnetospheric compression.

Conclusion: Gaia24ccy represents a unique outbursting system with characteristics distinct from known EXor sources. The outburst mechanism involves a hybrid picture combining thermal-viscous instability in a hot inner disk with magnetospheric compression. Mid-infrared reddening during outburst results from competing emission from the viscous disk and photosphere.

Abstract: Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects remain poorly understood, largely limited by a statistically small sample of closely followed-up events. This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $Δg \sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\rm trigger} \simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\sim5-12.3 R_\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\rm acc}\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.

### [12] [Stellar Paternity Tests: Matching High-Latitude B Stars to the Open Clusters of their Birth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16925)
*Brandon Schweers,M. Virginia McSwain*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Using Gaia DR3 data, researchers traced trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 open clusters to identify parent-orphan pairs through kinematic matching and age verification, finding origins for 5 orphaned stars and analyzing their ejection mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OB stars at high Galactic latitudes are unusual since they typically form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk. Their presence at high latitudes suggests they were ejected from their birth clusters, and identifying their origins can provide insights into stellar ejection mechanisms and cluster dynamics.

Method: Used Gaia DR3 astrometric data to trace kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters. Searched for past intersections between star and cluster trajectories. For matching cases, verified age consistency using cluster HR diagrams. Analyzed cluster core environments to determine probable ejection mechanisms.

Result: Identified possible origins for five orphaned B-type stars through successful paternity tests. Determined travel times and ejection velocities for each case. Found one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the analysis period, requiring discussion of alternative origins.

Conclusion: The study successfully traced origins of high-latitude B-type stars using Gaia DR3 data, demonstrating that kinematic trajectory analysis combined with age verification can identify parent-orphan star-cluster pairs. The approach provides insights into stellar ejection mechanisms and the dynamics of open clusters in the Milky Way.

Abstract: OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Multi-instrument study of a CME on 14 May reveals four type-II radio bursts generated at different coronal heights near CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize type-II radio bursts associated with a CME event, identify shock locations where radio bursts are generated, and understand coronal conditions during the event.

Method: Combined white light and EUV observations from GOES-SUVI, SOHO-LASCO coronagraphs, and ground-based radio observations (10-240 MHz) from I-LOFAR. Used PFSS and MHD models to examine coronal plasma conditions and density models to determine radial distances of radio sources.

Result: Identified four type-II bursts over ~15 minutes with features like band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. Shock speeds ranged ~443-2075 km/s, drift rates ~-361 to -78 kHz/s, and Alfvén Mach numbers MA ≈ 3.21-3.57 (super-Alfvénic). First burst triggered ~18 minutes after CME launch, each at different coronal heights. Analysis suggests bursts produced at CME shoulders near flanks where open magnetic field lines and low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation.

Conclusion: Multiple type-II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modeling indicating generation near CME flanks where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation, providing insights into CME-driven shock dynamics.

Abstract: This study characterises a series of type~II radio bursts associated with a CME that occurred on 14 May, focusing on the coronal conditions during the event and identifying the likely location of the shocks where the radio bursts are generated. The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfvénic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.

### [14] [Lithium as a probe of stellar and galactic physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17470)
*C. Charbonnel,N. Prantzos*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Lithium serves as a key astrophysical diagnostic for stellar evolution, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology, with current research pointing toward unified stellar models, novae as the primary Galactic Li source, and radial migration as crucial for understanding Milky Way Li evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium's unique properties make it an essential diagnostic tool for understanding low-mass stellar physics, Galactic chemical evolution, and cosmological processes, necessitating a comprehensive review of observational data and theoretical models.

Method: Review approach examining Li observations across stellar evolutionary phases, evaluating theoretical stellar models' capabilities and limitations, analyzing Li sources, and tracing Li evolution throughout Galactic history.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Advanced stellar evolution models with chemical species and angular momentum transport can explain Li depletion patterns across all Galactic populations; 2) Novae are likely the dominant Galactic Li source based on observational evidence; 3) Radial migration of stars is essential for understanding Milky Way Li evolution.

Conclusion: Lithium remains a powerful astrophysical diagnostic, with current research converging on unified stellar models, novae as the primary Li source, and radial migration as the key mechanism for explaining Galactic Li evolution patterns.

Abstract: Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology. We review the Li observations in stars at different phases of their evolution, the strengths and the limitations of the current theoretical stellar models to explain the Li abundance data, our understanding of the Li sources and of the evolution of Li through- out the Galactic history. Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.
