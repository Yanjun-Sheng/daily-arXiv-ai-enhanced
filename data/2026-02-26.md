### [1] [Testing models for fully and partially stripped low-mass stars with Gaia: Implications for hot subdwarfs, binary RR Lyrae, and black hole impostors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21289)
*Pranav Nagarajan,Kareem El-Badry,Alexey Bobrick,Giuliano Iorio,Francisco Molina,Joris Vos,Maja Vučković*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Binary evolution models predict continuum of stripped-star products from hot subdwarfs to undermassive red clump stars, but Gaia DR3 observations show discrepancies: overprediction of hot subdwarf binaries and predicted RR Lyrae binaries not observed, while red clump binaries with high mass functions match predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test binary evolution models predicting a continuum of stripped-star products (hot subdwarfs, horizontal branch stars, undermassive red clump stars) by comparing predictions with Gaia DR3 observations of astrometric binaries.

Method: Model binary populations in simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map; generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law; fit with cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3; compare simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions.

Result: Model significantly overpredicts hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions (flux ratios more unequal than observed); predicts >100 RR Lyrae with DR3 orbital solutions but none observed; model plausibly explains population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions (potential black hole impostors).

Conclusion: RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted; stripped-star binary models need revision; DR4 with longer period sensitivity will provide stronger tests of wide-orbit systems, potentially detecting ~10× more stripped-star binaries.

Abstract: When low-mass ($\lesssim 2$ $M_{\odot}$) red giants lose their envelopes to a companion just before the helium flash, the resulting mass transfer can produce binaries hosting hot subdwarfs, horizontal branch stars, and undermassive red clump stars. Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\sim 10 \times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems.

### [2] [Calibration of the [C/N] and [Y/Mg] chemical clocks with asteroseismic ages from the TESS space mission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21413)
*E. Pakštienė,G. Tautvaišienė,V. Bagdonas,H. Kjeldsen,M. L. Winther,A. Drazdauskas,C. Viscasillas Vázquez,Y. Chorniy,Š. Mikolaitis,R. Minkevičiūtė,E. Stonkutė*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper establishes empirical relations between chemical abundance ratios ([C/N] and [Y/Mg]) and stellar ages using asteroseismic ages from TESS data, revealing Galactic radial dependence and the importance of NLTE corrections and evolutionary stage considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve stellar age estimation for field stars by calibrating emerging empirical methods based on chemical abundance ratios, specifically addressing the need to account for stellar evolutionary stages, birth locations in the Galaxy, and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects.

Method: Analyzed 1250 F, G, and K giants using TESS data to detect solar pulsations; determined asteroseismic ages with BASTA and PARAM codes; derived NLTE abundances for Y and Mg; separated stars by evolutionary stage for [C/N] analysis; examined relations across Galactic thin disc regions and thick disc.

Result: Obtained asteroseismic ages for 218 giants; revealed radial dependence of [Y/Mg]-age relation across Galactic disc (steeper in outer disc, flatter toward inner disc, very flat in thick disc); demonstrated NLTE corrections are essential for precise age estimation from [Y/Mg]; showed evolutionary stage must be considered for [C/N] age indicators.

Conclusion: Chemical abundance ratios [Y/Mg] and [C/N] can serve as reliable stellar age indicators when properly calibrated with asteroseismic ages, accounting for Galactic position, NLTE effects, and evolutionary stage, providing crucial constraints for Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies.

Abstract: Context. Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account.

### [3] [On the Importance of the Convective Urca Process in 3D Simulations of a Simmering White Dwarf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21440)
*Ferran Poca-Amorós,Brendan Boyd,Dean M. Townsley,Alan Calder*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 3D simulations show convective Urca process significantly reduces convection zone size in pre-supernova white dwarfs but convection still extends beyond Urca shell.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the poorly understood convective Urca process during the simmering phase of Type Ia supernovae progenitors, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions in near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs.

Method: Used low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations of pre-supernova white dwarf convection, comparing simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process after reaching steady state.

Result: Convective Urca process substantially reduces the size of the convection zone, though convection still extends past the Urca shell; affects neutrino losses, nuclear energy generation, and convective boundary structure.

Conclusion: Findings on convective zone structure and compositional changes can inform 1D stellar models tracking longer-timescale evolution of Type Ia supernova progenitors.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.

### [4] [Retarded Stellar Dynamo in Tidally Deformed M Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21683)
*Song Wang,Wenbo Li,Henggeng Han,Dali Kong,Jifeng Liu,Xinlin Zhao*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables show an anti-correlation between stellar cycle and rotational periods, unlike single M dwarfs, suggesting deformation affects dynamo processes by weakening convection and differential rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stellar dynamo studies focus on spherical stars, leaving behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. The relationship between stellar cycle periods and rotational periods in non-spherical geometries needs investigation to understand how stellar deformation affects dynamo processes.

Method: Analyzed a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables to examine P_cyc-P_rot relation. Conducted numerical simulations to study thermal convection and differential rotation in highly distorted stars.

Result: Found anti-correlation between P_cyc and P_rot in tidally distorted M dwarfs, contrasting with single M dwarfs. Greater deformation leads to longer cycle periods. Simulations show thermal convection weakens and differential rotation reduces in highly distorted stars.

Conclusion: Stellar deformation affects dynamo behavior by weakening convection and reducing differential rotation, which may lengthen conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, explaining the observed P_cyc-P_rot anti-correlation in cataclysmic variables.

Abstract: Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\rm cyc}$-$P_{\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.

### [5] [Is Mira B a low mass white dwarf?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21725)
*R. K. Zamanov,V. Irincheva,B. Spassov,A. Kurtenkov,D. Marchev,M. Minev,M. F. Bode,L. Dankova,B. Borisov,M. Dechev,G. Yordanova*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study of short-term variability (flickering) in Mira (omicron Ceti) reveals accretion onto a low-mass white dwarf companion through wind Roche lobe overflow during Mira's pulsation minimum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the short-term photometric variability (flickering) in Mira during its pulsation minimum, which provides evidence for accretion processes in the Mira AB binary system and constrains properties of the white dwarf companion.

Method: Photometric observations in Johnson B and V bands over 7 nights during August-October 2025, during Mira's pulsation minimum. Analysis of flickering amplitude, luminosity estimation using amplitude-flux relation, and modeling assuming wind Roche lobe overflow accretion.

Result: Flickering amplitude of 0.11-0.28 mag in B band, flickering source luminosity 0.10-0.46 L_sun, accretion disc luminosity L_d = 0.91 ± 0.28 L_sun. Mira B is a low-mass white dwarf with M_wd = 0.24 ± 0.04 M_sun accreting at 6.8×10⁻⁹ M_sun/yr, placing it in the extremely low mass white dwarf category.

Conclusion: The observed flickering confirms ongoing accretion in the Mira AB system via wind Roche lobe overflow, with Mira B identified as an extremely low mass white dwarf, providing insights into binary evolution and accretion processes in evolved stellar systems.

Abstract: We report photometric observations in Johnson B and V bands of the short term variability (flickering) of Mira (omicron Ceti). The observations were performed during 7 nights in the period August - October 2025, in the course of the last minimum of the Mira pulsations. The observed peak-to-peak amplitude of the flickering is 0.11-0.28 mag in B band. For the flickering source we find luminosity in the range 0.10-0.46 L_sun. Using the amplitude-flux relation, we estimate an average luminosity of the accretion disc L_d = 0.91 +/- 0.28 L_sun.
  Assuming that the white dwarf accretes material through Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF), we find that Mira B is a low mass white dwarf with M_wd = 0.24 +/- 0.04 M_sun accreting at a rate 6.8x10^{-9} M_sun/yr. This value of the mass is in the range of the extremely low mass white dwarfs.

### [6] [Sub-second cadence structure of optical flares on AD Leo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21726)
*B. Schmercz,B. Seli,K. Vida,L. Kriskovics,A. Görgei,K. Oláh,Zs. Regály*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Analysis of 0.3s-cadence photometry from AD Leo reveals flare substructures on timescales of a few seconds but no sub-second quasi-periodic pulsations, suggesting exposure times of ~4-5s capture most information in single-filter observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess information content in high-speed photometry, addressing the scarcity of high-cadence flare observations despite their value for understanding magnetic reconnection mechanisms.

Method: Six-year observing campaign of active M-dwarf AD Leo with 0.3s-cadence photometry; time-frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations; statistical measures of time series complexity on binned flare light curves.

Result: Detected 42 flares in 211 hours; flare frequency distribution consistent with literature; no quasi-periodic pulsations below few seconds; two candidate signals at ~1 and 3 minutes; complexity analysis shows plateau at ~4-5s binning for complex flares.

Conclusion: High-cadence observations reveal flare substructures on few-second timescales but no features below that; exposure times of a few seconds are sufficient to retain most information in single-filter observations.

Abstract: Stellar flares are sudden brightenings caused by magnetic reconnection and are frequently observed on late-type stars. High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time--frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of ~4--5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that.

### [7] [The accretion discs in WZ Sge-type stars in deep quiescence. How do they outburst?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21850)
*Vitaly Neustroev,Paula Kvist,Miikka Siitonen,Veera Vuolteenaho*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Observations of quiescent WZ Sge-type dwarf novae reveal accretion discs with extremely low mass-transfer rates, optically thin conditions, and no pre-outburst brightening, contradicting DIM predictions and challenging standard explanations for superoutbursts and superhump formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the consistency of the disc instability model (DIM) predictions with observed properties of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence, particularly regarding the triggering mechanism for their rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts.

Method: Analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence, measuring accretion disc properties including mass-accretion rates, optical thickness, surface density, effective temperature, and disc radii.

Result: Quiescent WZ Sge-type systems show extremely low mass-accretion rates (~10⁻¹³ M☉ yr⁻¹), entirely optically thin discs with conditions below DIM instability thresholds, no pre-outburst disc brightening, mass-transfer rates ~5×10⁻¹² M☉ yr⁻¹ (order of magnitude lower than assumed), and disc radii near tidal truncation radius exceeding 3:1 resonance radius.

Conclusion: No observational evidence supports enhanced mass transfer as the trigger for superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems; DIM predictions are inconsistent with observations; standard superhump formation interpretation is questionable due to disc radii exceeding 3:1 resonance radius; previously assumed mass-transfer rates for WZ Sge are likely overestimated.

Abstract: WZ Sge-type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae characterised by very rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts. Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions -- such as surface density and effective temperature -- remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$~5$\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation.

### [8] [A deep HST view of the open cluster NGC2158: binaries, mass functions, and M-dwarf discontinuity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21882)
*A. V. Marchuk,F. Muratore,A. P. Milone,M. V. Legnardi,F. D'Antona,G. Cordoni,A. Mastrobuono-Battisti,E. Bortolan,F. Dell'Agli,E. Dondoglio,E. P. Lagioia,A. F. Marino,M. Tailo,C. Ventura,P. Ventura,T. Ziliotto*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Study of binary systems and mass function in intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 using HST imaging reveals mass-dependent binary fraction (decreasing from 52% at 1.0 M☉ to 11% at 0.2 M☉) and three-regime mass function with discontinuity at ~0.3 M☉.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary systems are crucial for understanding stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics, but key issues remain unresolved for photometric binaries among low-mass stars in clusters. The mass function of very low-mass stars is poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr, and cluster binary fractions have been suggested to be approximately constant over limited mass ranges, unlike the field.

Method: Deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 was used to investigate its binary population and derive luminosity and mass functions down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster.

Result: Global binary fraction of 38% consistent with other open clusters, with clear mass dependence decreasing from ~52% at 1.0 M☉ to ~11% at 0.2 M☉. Mass function shows three regimes: high-mass stars (α = -2.49 ± 0.19), low-mass stars (α = -1.11 ± 0.09), and very low-mass stars (α = -0.08 ± 0.07). Detected main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 M☉ possibly linked to 3He-driven instability.

Conclusion: The mass-dependent binary fraction in NGC 2158 mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The mass function slope change near 1.0 M☉ agrees with recent surveys, though a deficit below ~0.3 M☉ is found. The main-sequence discontinuity at ~0.3 M☉ may be analogous to the Jao Gap in field stars, potentially linked to 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models.

Abstract: A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars.

*David Boyd*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Spectroscopic analysis of five Mira stars (RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas, OR Cep) showing their spectral behaviors, emission line development, and how atmospheric pulsations generate Balmer emission through shock formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mira stars are ideal for spectroscopic study due to their brightness and large pulsation-induced brightness variations, making them accessible to both amateur astronomers and professional researchers for detailed atmospheric analysis.

Method: Spectroscopic observations of five specific Mira stars (RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas, OR Cep), with graphical presentation of their spectral behaviors and emission line development, focusing on how atmospheric pulsations produce shocks that generate Balmer emission.

Result: Documentation of different spectral behaviors and emission line development in the observed Mira stars, demonstrating how atmospheric pulsations create shocks that produce Balmer emission, with the carbon-oxygen balance determining spectral classification.

Conclusion: Mira stars provide excellent opportunities for spectroscopic study of stellar atmospheres, with their pulsations creating observable shock phenomena and emission lines that reveal atmospheric dynamics and chemical composition.

Abstract: Mira stars are popular with amateur astronomers because they are generally bright and their pulsations produce large changes in brightness. This also means they are eminently suitable to study using spectroscopy. We report here on spectroscopic observations of five Mira stars: RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas and OR Cep. We describe the lifecycle of a Mira star and explain how the carbon-oxygen balance in its atmosphere determines its spectral classification. Atmospheric pulsations in these stars produce shocks which generate Balmer emission. We present graphically their different spectral behaviours and development of emission lines.

TL;DR: The paper presents an updated MIST database with expanded alpha-element variations, improved physics, and comprehensive validation against other stellar evolution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide more comprehensive stellar evolution models that account for variations in alpha-capture elements, which is crucial for accurately modeling stellar populations with different chemical compositions and for comparison with observational data.

Method: Updated and expanded the MIST database to include [alpha/Fe] variations from -0.2 to +0.6 for metallicities -3 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +0.5, implemented self-consistently from stellar interior models to synthetic spectra, with physics updates and validation against previous MIST generation and literature models.

Result: Successfully produced updated stellar evolution tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables with alpha-element variations, validated against existing models, with all data products available online and reproducible files on Zenodo.

Conclusion: The expanded MIST database with alpha-element variations provides improved tools for stellar population studies and enables more accurate comparisons between theoretical models and observational data across diverse chemical compositions.

Abstract: We update and expand the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) database to include variations in the alpha-capture elements, specifically [alpha/Fe]=-0.2, 0, +0.2, +0.4, and +0.6 for -3 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.5. Variations in [alpha/Fe] are included in a self-consistent manner from the stellar interior models to the synthetic spectra used to translate these models in the observational plane. We describe a number of updates to the physics utilized in these models as well as new information provided by the models. We validate the models with comparisons to other stellar evolution models including the previous generation of MIST and other models from the literature. MIST data products including stellar evolutiont tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables can be obtained from the MIST project website, https://mist.science. All necessary files to reproduce MIST models are available from Zenodo.

TL;DR: VLBA multi-epoch survey of Orion compact radio sources yields precise trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions, revealing depth structure of Orion complex (380-440 pc) and providing independent calibration of Gaia reference frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To map embedded stellar populations in the Orion star-forming complex using high-precision radio astrometry and provide independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions where optical observations are limited.

Method: Multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey within DYNAMO-VLBA and GOBELINS projects, detecting 216 compact radio sources with 58 yielding reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions for trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements.

Result: Measured parallaxes range 2.26-2.65 mas (380-440 pc distances), with mean distances: NGC 2068 (405±16 pc), NGC 2024 (403±5 pc), σ Orionis (407±12 pc), ONC (388.5±1.7 pc), L1641 (438±12 pc). Comparison with Gaia DR3 shows negligible parallax offsets (-0.02±0.01 mas) and small proper motion differences (~0.07 mas yr⁻¹).

Conclusion: High-precision radio astrometry effectively maps embedded stellar populations and provides independent calibration of Gaia reference frame in obscured regions, demonstrating VLBA's capability for precise distance measurements in star-forming complexes.

Abstract: We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $σ$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($Δ\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.

TL;DR: Metallicity-sensitive CaHK photometry reveals extensive tidal tails around Crater II dwarf galaxy, indicating significant mass loss and a metallicity gradient, with implications for its dark matter halo profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crater II's unusual properties in cold dark matter simulations and recent discovery of tidal tails motivate detailed study to understand its tidal disruption history and constrain its dark matter halo profile.

Method: Used Dark Energy Camera with metallicity-sensitive narrowband CaHK photometry covering 128 deg² across Crater II's center and tidal tails as part of MAGIC survey. Combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections to identify 162 Crater II candidates.

Result: Identified 37 candidates in tidal tails extending ≥7° (∼95 kpc) from center, indicating ≥25% stellar mass loss. Detected first metallicity gradient (-0.34±0.17 dex deg⁻¹) in galaxy center. Stream width ∼0.8°, 50% larger than half-light radius. Tails extend beyond survey footprint. Comparison with N-body models shows ambiguous density profile between cored and cuspy dark matter halos.

Conclusion: Crater II has experienced significant tidal disruption with extensive stellar mass loss. The detected metallicity gradient and stream properties provide constraints for modeling, but the dark matter halo profile remains ambiguous and requires further investigation.

Abstract: Crater II (CraII), a large and low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxy, has unusual observed properties that are difficult to reproduce in cold dark matter simulations. Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\circ$ ($\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\pm0.17~{\rm dex}~{\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\sim 0.8^\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with "cored" and "cuspy" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: MUSE integral field spectroscopy enables separation of AGN and host galaxy light in Type 1 AGN, revealing a novel high-velocity (~25,000 km/s), short-timescale (≤1 yr) variable emission feature in PKS 2153-68.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectroscopy of Type 1 AGN suffers from contamination where host galaxy light blends with strong accretion disk and NLR/BLR emission, preventing accurate study of both galactic properties and central engine characteristics in AGN cores.

Method: Uses MUSE WFM integral field spectroscopy observations combined with a novel method for modeling and subtracting QSO light in Type 1 AGN, applied to the jetted, gamma-ray emitting source PKS 2153-68 (z=0.028).

Result: Successful separation of host galaxy and AGN spectra reveals an unprecedented discovery: an unresolved, unidentified high-velocity (~25,000 km/s) emission feature with short timescale variability (≤1 year), distinct from known AGN variability patterns.

Conclusion: Integral field spectroscopy enables precise study of both AGN cores and host galaxies, revealing novel phenomena like high-velocity variable emission that challenge current understanding of AGN physics and variability mechanisms.

Abstract: Historically, the study of the central regions of Type 1 AGN has been limited by the combination of the host galaxy spectrum with strong emission from the accretion disk and NLR/BLR, which prevented us from accurately probing the galactic and AGN properties in the central regions. Integral field spectroscopy allows us to correct for this effect and study both the unobscured cores of AGN host galaxies as well as the uncontaminated spectra of their central engines with unprecedented precision. Using MUSE WFM observations, in this work, we present a combined method for modelling and subtracting QSO light in type-1 AGN alongside results for one such source, PKS 2153-68 (z=0.028), both jetted and gamma-ray emitting. After separating the host galaxy and AGN spectra, we discuss the discovery of an unresolved and yet-to-be-identified high-velocity ($\sim$25000 km/s) short timescale ($\leq$1 yr) variable emission, unlike anything observed in other variable AGN.

*Hassen M. Yesuf,Connor Bottrell*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs reveals major discrepancies between observed galaxy properties and three major cosmological simulations (SIMBA, TNG, EAGLE), highlighting shortcomings in current AGN feedback modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in star formation, and to address uncertainties in AGN host galaxy measurements and modeling limitations that obscure the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across different environments and cosmic time.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15) with new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies, enabling unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations: SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE.

Result: Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. All simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments.

Conclusion: Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos, as current simulations show major shortcomings in reproducing observed galaxy properties and feedback effects.

Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos.

### [15] [FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of $z\sim 2$ Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21329)
*Michael A. Wozniak,Naveen A. Reddy,Pascal A. Oesch,Ivan Kramarenko,Jorryt Matthee,Chloe Neufeld,Irene Shivaei,Bahram Mobasher,Alice E. Shapley,Brian Siana*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: JWST FRESCO survey uses Paschen emission lines to study dust attenuation and star formation in 77 galaxies at z=1.43-2.65, revealing inside-out star formation patterns and Paschen lines' superior sensitivity to heavily obscured regions compared to Balmer lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand dust attenuation and star-formation rates in high-redshift galaxies by combining JWST Paschen line observations with ground-based Balmer line measurements, addressing limitations of Balmer decrement methods in patchy dust geometries.

Method: Combined JWST FRESCO survey Paschen emission line detections (Paα, Paβ) with MOSDEF survey ground-based Balmer line measurements (Hα, Hβ) for 77 galaxies at z=1.43-2.65. Used nebular and continuum emission maps to analyze spatial distributions, calculated nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) and Paschen-to-Balmer ratios (Paα/Hα, Paβ/Hα), assuming Milky Way extinction curve.

Result: Paschen emission covers smaller areas than continuum emission and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts, indicating inside-out star formation. Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs generally agree with Balmer-derived values, but some galaxies show significant differences. Non-unity dust covering fractions bias Balmer decrement toward less reddened regions, while Paschen lines are less affected and more sensitive to heavily obscured OB associations.

Conclusion: Paschen lines provide enhanced sensitivity to heavily obscured star-forming regions in high-redshift galaxies, especially in patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively will yield more robust constraints on dustiest star-forming regions, overcoming limitations of Balmer decrement methods.

Abstract: We present new constraints on dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) for 77 galaxies at redshifts $z=1.43-2.65$, using Paschen emission line detections from the JWST FRESCO survey and ground-based Balmer line measurements from the MOSDEF survey. Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $μ$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $μ$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$α$/H$α$ and Pa$β$/H$α$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions.

### [16] [Probing the magnetic fields and dust properties in the young embedded star-forming region AFGL 6366S using Near Infrared and Optical linear polarimetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21339)
*Samrat Biswas,Biman J Medhi,Motohide Tamura,H. S Das,Jungmi Kwon*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: NIR and optical polarimetry of AFGL 6366S reveals intrinsic polarization in 22 stars, a polarization hole in the dense central region due to RAT-D grain disruption, and magnetic field wrapping around two dense clumps with different magnetic criticality states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the magnetic field structure and dust grain properties in the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S using multi-wavelength polarimetry, particularly to understand the relationship between magnetic fields, star formation, and dust grain disruption mechanisms.

Method: Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry observations towards the AFGL 6366S cluster, analyzing polarization percentages, position angles, and magnetic field morphology in relation to dense molecular clumps and filamentary structures.

Result: Polarization ranges: 0.44-10.3% (NIR) and 0.16-11.22% (optical); 22 stars show intrinsic polarization; polarization hole in dense central region attributed to RAT-D grain disruption; magnetic field wraps around two dense clumps (radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc); field strengths: 447.91±83.81 μG and 396.66±73.64 μG; mass-to-flux ratios indicate one supercritical (λ∼1.34) and one subcritical (λ∼0.82) clump; both clumps in sub-Alfvénic state (M_A∼0.395, 0.393).

Conclusion: The magnetic field in AFGL 6366S is significantly misaligned with both Galactic and filament axes, showing complex morphology influenced by gravitational mass flows. The polarization hole suggests RAT-D disruption of large grains in dense regions. Different magnetic criticality states of clumps indicate varying roles of magnetic support in star formation within the same cluster environment.

Abstract: We present Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry towards the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S. The polarization ranges from 0.44-10.3 per cent in NIR and 0.16-11.22 per cent in Optical bands. The position angle spans $1^\circ - 179^\circ$ in both NIR and Optical bands. About 22 stars exhibit intrinsic polarization signatures. A polarization hole is evident towards the densest ($\sim 3.4 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warmest ($\sim 28.8 \mathrm{K}$) central cluster region. It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region. The field morphology wraps around two dense molecular clumps of radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc and $\mathrm N(\mathrm H_2)$ = $(7.9 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $(4.3 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The clumps are embedded in the filamentary structure and represent locally accelerated stages of mass accumulation. Gravitationally driven mass flows, largely perpendicular to the local magnetic field, produce a U-shaped field curvature across the filament axis. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths towards the two clumps are $ 447.91 \pm 83.81 μ\mathrm{G}$ and $396.66 \pm 73.64 μ\mathrm{G}$. The corresponding mass-to-flux ratios ($λ\sim 1.34$ and $0.82$) indicate that one clump is magnetically supercritical and the other is subcritical. The Alfven Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A$) $\sim$ 0.395 and 0.393 indicate that both the clumps are in sub-Alfvénic state.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct a comprehensive radio-continuum survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using MeerKAT's capabilities to enable various astrophysical studies and reveal new radio sources.

Method: Used MeerKAT telescope observations at 1.3 GHz with 0.8 GHz bandwidth, imaging six 5°×5° fields with 8" resolution, achieving median RMS noise of ~11 μJy beam⁻¹ in Stokes I.

Result: Identified new supernova remnant candidate; detected previously undetected planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars; imaged 30 Doradus star-forming region; discovered interesting foreground/background sources including AB Dor multiple-star system, radio ring galaxy, possible Odd Radio Circle, and bent-tail radio galaxy.

Conclusion: The MeerKAT LMC survey provides high-sensitivity radio data enabling diverse astrophysical studies, revealing new sources and phenomena, demonstrating MeerKAT's capabilities for extragalactic radio astronomy.

Abstract: We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.

*Lewis J Miller,Kathryn Grasha,Christoph Federrath*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: Spatially resolved measurements of turbulence driving modes across entire extragalactic discs of NGC7793 and NGC1313 reveal predominantly solenoidal driving with substantial spatial variation, including localized compressive regions, demonstrating systematic variation with galactic environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how turbulence driving modes vary systematically across galactic environments and link local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation, moving beyond the assumption of uniform turbulence driving across galactic discs.

Method: Used ALMA CO(J=2-1) observations at 13pc resolution to apply kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, mapping the turbulence driving parameter b that characterizes the balance between solenoidal (b~0.3) and compressive (b~1) turbulent driving regimes.

Result: Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average (b≥0.33±0.05 for NGC7793; b≥0.24±0.03 for NGC1313), with substantial spatial variation including localized compressive regions. Turbulence is supersonic (3≲M≲20), with NGC1313 showing higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in galaxy centers and increasingly compressive modes in outskirts.

Conclusion: Turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation.

Abstract: We present spatially resolved measurements of turbulence driving modes across entire extragalactic discs of NGC7793 and NGC1313, using Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) CO(J=2-1) observations at 13pc resolution. By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\geq 0.33(\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\geq 0.24(\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\lesssim M\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The study revisits the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) using a large sample of local galaxies, finding that the apparent correlation between star formation rate and stellar mass is actually mediated by molecular gas, making the molecular gas main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relation more fundamental.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous works and statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales by examining the relationships between star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass in a large sample of local galaxies.

Method: Used a volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies, estimated molecular gas mass from mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, established global density relations, and performed multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses to examine relationships between surface densities of star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass.

Result: Found that scatters in global Kennicutt-Schmidt and molecular gas main sequence relations are smaller than in the star formation rate-stellar mass relation, with higher Pearson correlation coefficients. Multivariate analysis showed the apparent correlation between star formation rate and stellar mass is entirely mediated by molecular gas density, with best-fit parameters derivable from the other two relations.

Conclusion: The correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, and between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations rather than a primary physical driver.

Abstract: We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations.

TL;DR: NGC 6447 shows mid-infrared brightening over 14 years while optical remains constant, indicating transition from quiescent galaxy to AGN as obscuring material disperses, revealing the central engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize AGN turning-on events where obscured accretion transitions to revealed AGN activity, using multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties to understand the early stages of AGN activation.

Method: Used WISE/NEOWISE mid-infrared light curves (3.5μm and 4.6μm bands) over 14 years, ASAS-SN optical monitoring, SPHEREx spectroscopy, NuSTAR X-ray observations, and Swift upper limits to analyze timing and spectral evolution.

Result: NGC 6447 showed 1.2 mag mid-IR brightening over 14 years while optical remained constant; transitioned to AGN in 2018; NuSTAR detected X-ray luminosity of 8.4×10⁴¹ erg/s with >7× variability; consistent with AGN turning-on as obscuring material disperses.

Conclusion: Long-term infrared variability effectively identifies AGN turning-on events; NGC 6447 demonstrates obscured-to-revealed AGN transition; estimated AGN accretion duty cycle episodes last 10⁴-10⁶ years.

Abstract: It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution tri-axial simulations are essential for realistic modeling of astrophysical jets but impose extreme computational demands that exceed CPU-based capabilities, requiring GPU acceleration solutions.

Method: Performance benchmarking of GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO) with direct comparisons of extragalactic jet propagation computations at different grid resolutions, followed by high-resolution 3D simulations of giant radio galaxy jets.

Result: gPLUTO achieves runtime speed-ups of 10-30× relative to CPU-only configurations, confirms physical fidelity, demonstrates importance of resolving jet radius for accurate dynamics, and enables first well-resolved 3D study of giant radio galaxy jets down to 500 pc scales.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration enables transformative computational capabilities for astrophysical jet simulations, allowing high-resolution 3D studies of giant radio galaxies that probe environmental effects, formation mechanisms, and morphological development previously inaccessible to computational studies.

Abstract: High-resolution tri-axial simulations are indispensable for realistically co-modeling the dynamical signatures and the radiative fingerprints of astrophysical jets, which are becoming increasingly important in modern computational studies of jet physics. However, such simulations impose extreme computational requirements that often exceed the capabilities of conventional CPU-based codes. GPU-accelerated simulations offer a transformative solution to mitigate these limitations. In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately. Leveraging GPU-PLUTO's capabilities, we finally present an application by performing high-resolution simulations of giant radio galaxy jets (GRGs $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc), representing the first such well-resolved 3D study to our knowledge (resolving scales down to 500 pc). These simulations probe a range of environmental effects on GRG jets, clarifying their formation from central galaxies within host cosmic structures, rapid peripheral expansion, and the development of asymmetric cocoon morphologies.
