Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts."}

A correct representation of these laws and the deviations from them is important for modelling the source term in surface flux transport and dynamo models of space climate variation, and it may also help constrain the subsurface origin of active regions. Here we determine active region scaling laws based on the recently constructed ARISE active region data base listing bipolar ARs for cycle 23, 24 and 25. For the area $A$, pole separation $d$ and tilt angle $γ$ we find scalings against magnetic flux $Φ$ and heliographic latitude $λ$. Residuals from these relations are also modelled. These scaling relations are recommended for use in space climate research for the modelling of future data or missing past data, as well as for the identification of candidate rogue ARs. We confirm that the tilt angle distribution of non-Hale ARs shows a significant excess at low tilts (anti-Hale ARs). In contrast to earlier studies we show that neither the anti-Hale ARs nor non-Hales in general follow Joy's law: instead, their tilt angle distribution is best represented by vanishing mean tilt. These results are most easily reconciled with a scenario where the AR flux loops originate in the deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during their rise under the action of the Coriolis force. A small fraction of the loops is subjected to extreme, intermittent torques resulting in either very large tilts or anti-Hale orientation. Anti-Hale ARs are suggested to be fully curled `XO-loops', and their excess is caused by a simple mechanical effect, as the contact of their legs increases resistance against further deformation by the torque."}

The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$α$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope."}

We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\\sim{\\rm constant}$ toward $j\\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_φ$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ.

These appear to confirm theoretical predictions that the relation between central black hole mass $M$ and spheroid velocity dispersion $σ$ has the same form $M \\propto σ^4$ in spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and cluster ellipticals, but has differing normalizations. These arise from the need for longer black hole accretion episodes to expel the gas otherwise potentially able to feed the holes in the latter two types of host. In a sample drawn from a mixture of galaxy host types the fitted power of $σ$ will slightly exceed the theoretically-derived value of 4 because of the differing normalizations. The observed hole masses do not currently reach the theoretical maximum values possible for disc accretion, set by the equality of the ISCO and self-gravity radii, probably because the host galaxies have insufficient gas."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\\,M_\\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \\textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\\,M_\\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\\sim 30$~Myr at $\\sim 70$-$130$~AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\\,M_\\odot$ and disappears by $15\\,M_\\odot$.

Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches."}

In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N>10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods."}

This study aims to present a rather comprehensive examination on the group velocities of trapped 3D kink modes in coronal slabs, emphasizing the connection of mode analysis to both mode characterization and impulsively excited 3D kink waves. We work in linear, ideal, pressureless MHD, and take the equilibrium slab to be symmetrically structured only in one transverse direction. The dispersion relation is numerically solved, with the results understood by making in-depth analytical progress. We address both the transverse fundamental and its first overtone.

Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$α$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$α$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$α$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$α$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$α$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$α$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$α$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$α$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available."}

Over the past few decades, extensive time-resolved photometry has revealed a rich diversity of superhump-related phenomena, including delayed superhump development, early superhumps in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, systematic stage A-B-C evolution, negative superhumps, and superhumps observed in related systems such as intermediate polars and AM CVn stars. In this invited review, we summarize key observational advances since the establishment of the thermal-tidal instability framework, discuss their theoretical interpretations within the disk instability model, and highlight remaining open problems. These developments have been driven by coordinated networks of amateur observers, wide-field robotic surveys, and continuous high-precision space-based photometry from Kepler and TESS. Together, they demonstrate that superhumps remain a powerful probe of disk dynamics, binary parameters, and the interplay between thermal, tidal, and geometric effects in accretion disks."}

We calibrate the simulations to match in stellar mass, isolating the effect of the models on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes, resulting in notable variations in the CGM properties. The delayed cooling run is dominated by ejective feedback and exhibits high burstiness, whereas mechanical and the hybrid models primarily feature preventive feedback, respectively acting at the galaxy and halo scales. Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models. While for delayed cooling and mechanical feedback metals are almost evenly distributed in the CGM, they are concentrated around satellites in the hybrid model. These discrepancies emphasize the need to design an appropriate subgrid model to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth."}

Column densities and covering fractions serve as effective diagnostics of subgrid models, with all four ions providing strong constraints as they trace diverse gas phases, exhibit complementary spatial distributions, and originate from different mechanisms. Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them. The simulation including mechanical feedback reproduces the observed CIV covering fractions well, whereas the other models show slight offsets.

Identifying these stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and in NGC4258 (for all three of which there are published geometric distances) we find that the marginalized luminosity functions are each well approximated by single-peaked Gaussians, having one-sigma dispersions of +/- 0.22 mag, +/- 0.25 mag and +/- 0.24 mag, respectively. The zero points for the modal I-band absolute magnitudes of IAGB stars are found to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003 mag (stat) in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag (stat), for the SMC sample (916 stars), and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag (stat) for NGC4258 (62 stars).

While optical abundance determinations rely on extensively validated line lists and modeling frameworks, infrared measurements still face larger uncertainties, largely driven by the choice of atmospheric models and the quality of the available atomic data. In this work, we aim to deliver a homogeneous and reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in the Y, J, and H bands (9800 - 18000 (Angstrom)), based exclusively on laboratory atomic data. We analyse CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning a wide range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Synthetic spectra are computed using the benchmark stellar parameters, and each transition is evaluated independently in every star through a quantitative sequence that examines line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and the agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles. We identify a set of robust atomic transitions in these bands that remain consistent across the full range of stellar parameters represented in our sample. Lines of alpha-elements such as Mg I, Si I, and Ca I, together with several Fe I transitions, satisfy all robustness criteria. Among the neutron-capture species explored, only Sr II provides lines that consistently meet our requirements. Beyond the specific list of accepted transitions, this study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve."}

From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant."}

A First Estimate of their Precision and a Differential Zero Point", "comment": null, "summary": "Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 92 galaxies that have a strong showing of I-band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) stars in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), are used to measure the relative offset between the mean apparent I-band magnitudes of the IAGB population and the corresponding apparent I-band magnitudes of the TRGB as measured in the same frames (and CMDs) of those individual galaxies. This first exploratory, large-sample comparison is independent of any extinction (foreground or internal) that may be shared by these two populations. The marginalized luminosity functions used to determine the modal value of the {\\it IAGB } population are well fit by a single, symmetric Gaussian. The difference in the two apparent magnitudes (in the sense IAGB minus TRGB) is -0.589 mag, with a combined standard deviation of +/- 0.119 mag. Adopting M_I = -4.05 mag for the TRGB stars, the modal absolute magnitude of the IAGB is then calculated to be M_I(IAGB) = -4.64 +/- 0.12 mag. The ensemble dispersion quoted above gives a standard error on the mean of +/- 0.012 mag (based on the full sample of 92 galaxies). Independently, the three geometry-based zero points for I-band AGB stars are found (in Paper I) to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003~mag in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag, for the SMC (916 stars) and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag for NGC4258 (62 stars), leading to a global zero-point (weighted) average of <M_I> = -4.64 +/- 0.15 mag (stat). The scatter found in the anchors is comparable to the scatter in the field sample discussed here, but the calibration sample is small. The application of this method to galaxies well outside of the Local Group, shows that these standard candles can readily be found and measured out to at least 9 Mpc, using already available archival data"}

We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region."}

They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $ε_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $ε_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $ε_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected."}

From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $ρ\\propto r^{-γ}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $γ= γ_0 + γ_z \\cdot z_l + γ_s \\cdot \\log \\tildeΣ$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\\tildeΣ$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $Λ$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $γ_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $γ_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $γ_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $γ$ increases with surface mass density ($γ_s > 0$) and decreases with redshift ($γ_z < 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing--dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy--galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure."}

Submitted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Cold atomic and molecular gas are commonly observed in the winds of both external galaxies and the Milky Way, yet the survival and origin of these cool phases within hot galactic winds is poorly understood. To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought."}

These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic.

They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $ω$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\\rm act}) \\ln (ν_{0}/ω)$ with $T_{\\rm act}$ activation temperature and $ν_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $χ_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm max}(ω)$ at $N_{\\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $ν_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments."}

However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $< -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $< -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($< 1.25$ $M_{\\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\\odot}$.

A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ with $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions."}

Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups."}

We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration."}

The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422.

The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations."}

From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant."}

Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found. These findings provide observational evidence that tidal perturbations in major mergers play a key role in regulating bar evolution."}

We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region."}

To be submitted to AAS journals in a week. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $ω$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\\rm act}) \\ln (ν_{0}/ω)$ with $T_{\\rm act}$ activation temperature and $ν_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $χ_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm max}(ω)$ at $N_{\\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $ν_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments."}

The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$α$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope."}

We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\\sim{\\rm constant}$ toward $j\\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_φ$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values.

On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "We combine narrow/medium-band filter photometry from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4 with ultra broad-band filter photometry from Gaia EDR3 to derive fundamental stellar parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], ages) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe] and [$α$/Fe]) for 5.4 million stars in the Galaxy (4.9 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants), as well as for over 0.7 million red giant stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The precisions of the abundance estimates range from 0.05-0.10 dex for metallicity in the relatively metal-rich range ([Fe/H] $> -1.0$) to 0.10-0.30 dex in the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $<-1.0$), 0.10-0.20\\,dex for [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [$α$/Fe]. The stellar parameters for LMC and SMC member stars are somewhat less precise than those from the S-PLUS main survey, primarily because of the effect of high reddening. The use of both metallicity- and carbon-sensitive filters provides unbiased measurements of both [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], of particular importance for very low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $< -2.0$) stars, where carbon enhancement can lead to systematically high estimates of [Fe/H] when only a single metallicity-sensitive filter is employed. Furthermore, multiple narrow-band filters enable metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\\sim -4.0$ with an accuracy of around 0.3 dex, exceeding the precision typically achieved by low/medium-resolution spectroscopy. This extensive photometric dataset, combined with the other three datasets in this series, will serve as a valuable legacy resource for Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds studies."}

Exploring a New Standard Candle for the Extragalactic Distance Scale", "comment": null, "summary": "In the I-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of resolved nearby galaxies, the reddest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars form a previously unremarked-upon, but nevertheless distinct and easily-identified population of high-luminosity stars. Hereafter we refer to this population as being comprised of I-Band AGB (IAGB) stars. Identifying these stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and in NGC4258 (for all three of which there are published geometric distances) we find that the marginalized luminosity functions are each well approximated by single-peaked Gaussians, having one-sigma dispersions of +/- 0.22 mag, +/- 0.25 mag and +/- 0.24 mag, respectively. The zero points for the modal I-band absolute magnitudes of IAGB stars are found to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003 mag (stat) in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag (stat), for the SMC sample (916 stars), and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag (stat) for NGC4258 (62 stars). A global average over these three independent calibrations of the IAGB zero point (weighted inversely by squares of their systematic errors) gives <M_I> = -4.65 +/- 0.119 mag (stat) +/- 0.025 (sys). In Paper II we will show the results of applying the IAGB Method to 92 galaxies additional galaxies resolved by HST, reaching out to distances just short of 10 Mpc."}

While optical abundance determinations rely on extensively validated line lists and modeling frameworks, infrared measurements still face larger uncertainties, largely driven by the choice of atmospheric models and the quality of the available atomic data. In this work, we aim to deliver a homogeneous and reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in the Y, J, and H bands (9800 - 18000 (Angstrom)), based exclusively on laboratory atomic data. We analyse CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning a wide range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Synthetic spectra are computed using the benchmark stellar parameters, and each transition is evaluated independently in every star through a quantitative sequence that examines line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and the agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles. We identify a set of robust atomic transitions in these bands that remain consistent across the full range of stellar parameters represented in our sample. Lines of alpha-elements such as Mg I, Si I, and Ca I, together with several Fe I transitions, satisfy all robustness criteria. Among the neutron-capture species explored, only Sr II provides lines that consistently meet our requirements. Beyond the specific list of accepted transitions, this study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve."}

A First Estimate of their Precision and a Differential Zero Point", "comment": null, "summary": "Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 92 galaxies that have a strong showing of I-band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) stars in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), are used to measure the relative offset between the mean apparent I-band magnitudes of the IAGB population and the corresponding apparent I-band magnitudes of the TRGB as measured in the same frames (and CMDs) of those individual galaxies. This first exploratory, large-sample comparison is independent of any extinction (foreground or internal) that may be shared by these two populations. The marginalized luminosity functions used to determine the modal value of the {\\it IAGB } population are well fit by a single, symmetric Gaussian. The difference in the two apparent magnitudes (in the sense IAGB minus TRGB) is -0.589 mag, with a combined standard deviation of +/- 0.119 mag. Adopting M_I = -4.05 mag for the TRGB stars, the modal absolute magnitude of the IAGB is then calculated to be M_I(IAGB) = -4.64 +/- 0.12 mag. The ensemble dispersion quoted above gives a standard error on the mean of +/- 0.012 mag (based on the full sample of 92 galaxies). Independently, the three geometry-based zero points for I-band AGB stars are found (in Paper I) to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003~mag in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag, for the SMC (916 stars) and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag for NGC4258 (62 stars), leading to a global zero-point (weighted) average of <M_I> = -4.64 +/- 0.15 mag (stat). The scatter found in the anchors is comparable to the scatter in the field sample discussed here, but the calibration sample is small. The application of this method to galaxies well outside of the Local Group, shows that these standard candles can readily be found and measured out to at least 9 Mpc, using already available archival data"}

Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited.\n  Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation.\n  Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $χ^2$ minimization is used for the fitting.\n  Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II.\n  Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data."}

Johnson"], "title": "[C/N] Ages and Extra-Mixing for [Fe/H] <- 0.5: Insights from the LMC and SMC", "comment": "Missing references or comments welcome", "summary": "The [C/N]-age relation has become a powerful tool for reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way (MW), providing the largest age sample for field giant stars. However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $< -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $< -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($< 1.25$ $M_{\\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies."}

Submitted to AAS journals. Comments welcome", "summary": "Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration."}
